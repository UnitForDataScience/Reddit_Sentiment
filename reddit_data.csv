I added up all the individual awards and the costs as of the time starting there was 4990 awards. 

Turns out a total of 2,411,187 coins had been spent on awards, this equates to $7670.49 at the standard reddit price of €214.99 for 82000 coins. (converted to dollars using current rate) 

This could have been 407.1 shares of GME or 325.7 shares of Pltr at current prices.

I've liquidated all of my positions, and am no longer bagholding that dogshit QS. And I'm happy to announce that despite the great QS debacle, I still closed with a profit for the month. Those 10 shares of GME I bought in solidarity with you retards single-handedly saved this challenge. I know I will get shit for selling them, and yes I should have held, but I was just happy to double my money and to start February with a clean slate.

I will be posting a new thread as well as some upcoming trade ideas on the first of February. May be taking my trades in a completely different direction. I'm short my projected goal for the month, but hopefully I can get things back on track next month. Thanks to whoever is still following.

=========================================

**Current Positions: 2 GME @ 300**

**+20 SLV 30c 4/12 @ 1.35**

**Current ROI: 4%**

**Projected Year-End ROI: 60%**

**Trades:**

**Update (1/8/21):**

I took a very big risk trading QS, and have been getting hammered hard by it recently. However, things are not as bad as they appear, when you consider the insane amount of premium I am collecting...

My true cost basis is $65 - $5.50 premium = $59.5 / share. After selling a single weekly covered call, that cost basis will drop to around $54 / share. Each additional weekly CC will continue to drop the cost basis over time. Which means **even with the stock I own being down 20% from my entry, I would still end up with a profit.** That is the power of selling extremely high IV options.

Only if QS tanks well below $50, and stays there for months on end, do I risk an actual loss on this trade. I just hope that doesn't happen...

**Update (1/17/21):**

Well, I really picked a dogshit stock, and now I'm stuck bagholding 100 shares of it...

QS has tanked hard consistently and is now down a whopping 21% from my entry point. Still, I'm going to follow my general rule and not close this position for a loss. I need to find the breakeven covered call. Which means: the intersection point where premium gained from the CC reduces my cost basis to match the strike price of the same CC. At the moment that appears to be almost exactly ATM.

**Option: QS 54c 1/29 = $5.50 premium**

**Cost basis: $65 (assignment) - $5.50 (CSP premium) - $5.50 (CC premium) = $54**

Again, this is the power of Theta Gang on high IV stocks, and why it will always outperform ""buy and hold."" Even with the stock being down 20%, I can still break even at the current price, and all I will have lost is time. Anyone who simply bought shares at the same exact time I entered my CSP would now be down 20% with little hope of recovery. I will of course have to reevaluate the prices Tuesday morning.

**LESSON LEARNED:** Don't be greedy. I was too enticed by the extremely high premium on QS. If I would have continued the more conservative PLTR play from last week, I'd be sitting pretty right now. Hopefully I can still recover and get this challenge back on track next week.

Positions and ROI to be updated Tuesday morning.

**Update (1/20/21):**

Another horrible -7% day for the QS shares we are bagholding. This stone looks like it will never stop dropping. I need to earn premium more quickly to reduce this cost basis as fast as possible. I went with a 30DTE option for $630 to drop my cost basis down to $51.50 per share. Luckily the IV is still sky high, making these significant cost basis reductions possible. However, if this continues tanking through the end of the month, we may just be done for...

**====================================================**

# Introduction

**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades.

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility >80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume >5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap >$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price <$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

GME Reality and Fantasy Prediction,question,243,0.94,koezbj,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koezbj/gme_reality_and_fantasy_prediction/,137,"  GME is going to have a BIG week.
Here is why:

- RC plays like a chess grandmaster 
- 2 large buys on 12/30 (one intraday and one AH)
- 1st buy came just before RC’s tweets (mocking bears and warning that they are figuratively about to be burned alive in a house fire)
- Both large buys came in around the lows of the day
- QTR 4 in March will be a blowout
- Conference on Jan 11
- Probable release of holiday sales figures before conference
- Ridiculous % of shares sold short
- Hype on this stock is ratcheting up
- $600 stim checks are already in many of our accounts

How much more pain can the short sellers take? 

My crazy prediction/fantasy:

I think we go up 5% by 10 AM Monday,  Jan 4th. 

If a 13d comes out, we are looking at an immediate jump to $28 per share. From there, we go into a 3 day squeeze that will take us past $30 on day 1 (probably Tuesday Jan 5th by noon). On day 2 GME flys by $40, $50, $60, and momentarily hits $140 pps until it settles down around $80 pps by close on Day 3, which would be Thursday Jan 7th.

Again, all of this is probably just wishful thinking. But, it may come true.",2021-01-02 01:21:00,

I’ve been doing quite a bit of research on Palantir. There’s a few objectives for my research. 
1: To actually understand what it is.

2: To assess the long term growth potential.

3: To assess possible competition and how that could thwart market domination

Through all of this I became very excited initially. 

As this seems to be a free thinking pathway that can intermediate between pseudo “subconscious” types of data relationships that would be unexplored by 99% of other data platforms.

Then I became quite terrified, really. 
This data is being used by central governments for the most part and huge corporations.

This is the medium between the value of data and the implications of everything that could be done with the amounts of data with no stone left unturned.

Not all of it will be good, that can be assured.

https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/about

From Covid tracking to ICE deportations. Palantir has data on otherwise low data groups with not much of a digital footprint.

The thing is that people like you and I, who have a massive data footprint will be most susceptible to the ways it uses data over the next few decades.

While I’m still working on 2 and 3. I think my first question came with more questions than answers.

I’m long on Pltr 01/22cand 01/23c 

This is straight out of a comic book y’all.

If I’m going to be forced to indentured servitude I might as well have a few bucks in the bank as well. I’ll ride this baby to the top. 


Oh, and for those who fear the government might break it up, it won’t be regulated by the government.

The government will be regulated by PLTR.

Getting Around The PDT Rule,question,4,0.59,kog9yt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kog9yt/getting_around_the_pdt_rule/,6,"When you take that step to [become a day trader,](https://www.stockheadslive.com/invest) you will run into situations your long term investing friends usually don’t deal with. 

Individuals who are looking to to enter and exit a trade on the same day (day trade) more than 3 times a week are restricted in doing so by the Pattern Day-Trade Rule or, “PDT”. There are important exceptions to this rule that new investors should understand and consider.

1. Does not apply to cash accounts
2. Does not apply to accounts LARGER than 25k
3. For every one account you open you get 3 day trades a week.

Assuming most of us don’t have $25,000 to put into an investing account right away and opening multiple accounts can over complicate your investing, we are going to go with **opening a cash account.**

A cash account in investing is a direct/non-credit account. This means you will receive no margin/funds from your [broker](https://tdameritrade.com/) to invest with on top of your initial cash balance. **There is no day trading limit on cash accounts**, keep in mind though this also means you will have to wait for your money to clear which usually takes 2-3 days from the closing date of a stock position. **Good news for options traders!** Funds from your daily option buying and selling are available the next day for you to trade with, without the PDT rule. Funds recieved from closing option contracts take less time to clear than funds recived from closing stock positions.

Many traders will allocate the amount of money they will use to buy and sell options. For new traders, lets say I have $1000, I am going to put $800 in long term positions and use $200 to trade options. If I buy an AMD contact for $180, even if I sell that AMD contract right after buying it, that $180 won’t be available for me to use again until it has cleared the following morning. This is one of the many reasons why it is important for small account holders to plan their trades, ensuring they will have funds available to them for their planned entrances.

That’s it… a cash account is the best option by far for aspiring day traders.\* make sure to Pay attention to the account type you have opened with your broker. They want everyone to open a margin account. Financially this makes the most since for them, but maybe not for you.",2021-01-02 02:33:39,

GME Price Targets for 2021 💎🙌 (According to the Short Float Data) 🚀,question,545,0.92,kow6gs,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kow6gs/gme_price_targets_for_2021_according_to_the_short/,254,"💎🙌 GME GANG CHECKING IN. 💎🙌

Dear GME gang 🚀,

I wanted to share my Price Targets (PT) for GME but no BS here. I give you my PT according to actual facts.

Let’s take a look at the table and check when the short % of free float went from a high point (\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\~140%) - which by the way they, in absolute terms,  both are huge numbers of course - I won't talk about the potential short-squeeze here (I will publish the ultimate DD on GME TOMORROW and talk about it in here, stay tuned).

&#x200B;

[www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4h6ff/this\_week\_will\_be\_the\_final\_blow\_for\_gme\_shorts/](https://preview.redd.it/zojf6rxwnw861.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=a535a48d71f7c0ec722e766018004eca4aa9c1b0)

The stock went up \~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that 💎🙌-ing is key to capture most of the gains. Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock at the time you could “feel” like you bled all along esp. when you watch the stats:

*Positive daily returns:          49.3%*

*Negative daily returns:         50.7%*

BUT IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD. CHECK THIS OUT:

*Best daily return:                   23.0 %*

*Worst daily return:                -13.7 %*

Imagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just 💎🙌 and let those shorts go bankrupt.

Okay, here I showed **FACTS**. Stuff that actually happened. Now here is **my opinion about a reasonable price target** according to the data.

I think we could **easily** hit +80% over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesn’t even account for the fact that some short-sellers will not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some shorts have a triple-digit % drawdown already.

# Conclusion

**Price targets for the 3-6 next months according to the data from 2019-2020 (assuming the short float drops by 20%)** :

* Conservative:  $34 without a short-squeeze (+80%)  🚀
* Likely to happen: $50 without a short-squeeze (+180%) 🚀🚀
* Optimist:  $70 without a short-squeeze (+372%) 🚀🚀🚀

So I'd suggest that for those of you who DO NOT believe in a short-squeeze to put a take profit at around 70-80$.

Note that these are price targets assume the short % of free float go down to \~140%, if it goes to 130% or even less the price could go up substantially more. And...

**Keep in mind that my PTs are overall all VERY CONSERVATIVE given that:**

1. I DIDN'T even account for the fact that the next earnings will be good/great.
2. I didn’t even account for the fact that Ryan Cohen’s stake is now at 12.9% - those will NOT be sold, so the potential sell-pressure will be LESS than before = bullish.
3. With a short-squeeze I have actually no idea where this could go but again **very easily $100+**.

**I WILL PUBLISH THE ULTIMATE DD ON GME TOMORROW BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT (100% TENDIES, 0% BS IN HERE).**

**Positions**: a lot of shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Disclamer for the bears:  I only try to make the best PT estimations and share it with you all. I do my estimation, not by technical analysis but with actual data and what I believe to be the best hypothesis (short float will decrease by 20%). By no means I am saying I can see into the future unlike some people seem to think. I thought it was obvious but I must clarify it apparently. Anyway, I put my money where my mouth is and I share my personal insights that's it. If you really think I am wrong, by all means go ahead and buy some puts or short the stock, I'll be glad, the money you will lose is the money we will earn.",2021-01-02 19:41:10,

Why $EDIT is going to be a unique monster st(co)ck 👀 🚀🚀,dd,42,0.83,koxdgl,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koxdgl/why_edit_is_going_to_be_a_unique_monster_stcock/,62,"Rockets made u click uh retard? Welcome on board brother.

Let's start with an introduction: **Editas Medicine** is a clinical-stage [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology) company which is developing therapies based on [CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing) technology. It can count on a strong 5 star team, such as Dr. Feng Zhang (Pioneer in CRISPR) , Dr. George Church from Harvard (this guy is actually so positively retarded that he's going to bring back **Mammoths** to life through gene editing [https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/progress/](https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/progress/) ) and it was also co-founded by Jennifer Doudna (Noble Prize for CRISPR).

Why am I betting onto this one? Amongst the other CRISPR related stocks, Editas shines as the only company with a 'best in class' Investigational New Drug called EDIT-101. [https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-fda-acceptance-ind-application-edit](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-fda-acceptance-ind-application-edit) 

&#x200B;

EDIT-101 is currently in early stage clinical phase, on the path to be FDA approved, and it is being developed to cure LCA (Leber Congenital Amaurosis). **WHAT THE FUCK IS LCA**? For noobs and retards like myself, in synthesis it's BLINDNESS. Here's an explanation for the brave:

* LCA is the most common cause of inherited childhood **blindness** with 3/100,000 children around the world affected
* Symptoms of LCA appear within the first years of life, resulting in significant **vision loss** and potential blindness
* Symptoms include:
   * Significant vision loss
   * Rapid involuntary eye movement
   * No measurable electroretinogram activity due to loss of **photoreceptor** cells (the cells in the eye that take in light and help us see)
* The most common form of the disease, LCA10, accounts for approximately 20-30 percent of all LCA patients
* LCA10 is caused by mutations in the *CEP290* gene
* **There are currently no treatment options available for LCA10**

Yes, there are currently no options to cure this. That's why I'm so bullish on this stock and its future, if in the next few years it gets FDA approval, you'll see this stock skyrocket to Jupiter on a SpaceX rocket made by Papa Elon. **CHECK THIS ARTICLE OUT**  [**https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-demonstrates-dose-dependent-vivo-editing-edit**](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-demonstrates-dose-dependent-vivo-editing-edit) . Their treatment has been proven successful on human cells, mice and non-human primates, I'm confident the path to curing this disease is in good hands and I have faith Editas is going to be the first company to achieve such accomplishment.

CRSPR and NTLA are focusing and more advanced in clinical trials on curing Sickle Cell Disease or Beta-Thalassemia, I need to look and do more research into this. Cathie Wood is betting on the disruptive technologies into the genomic space and she thinks that most of these stocks are going to outperform Tesla in the next 5/10 years.

Solar spot discussion and what does it mean for the financial market?

As we all know, the sun controls our lives and financial markets. Recently we have passed the halfway point of the solar activity trough. Because of this, I am predicating that SPY will reach 430 dollars by the end of 2021, as we leave the bearish cycle of the sun and enter the hyper sunshin bullrun. These are fundamentals, since the sun is a fundamental indication of our financials. -- yes I am not a fucking notradomeass for predicting stocks go up. Also made username in 2019.

According to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.
After hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.
Once the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.
# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls
Options market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.
Specifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.
PLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.
# Institutional funds rebalancing
Even though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.
# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021
Because PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.
# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry
Palantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings. It's plausible that, like new-year-profit-taking, traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock-up period ending.
# Price chart sell signals
Technical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.

Palantir $22.5M contract with Japan,news,745,0.94,kq7dq0,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kq7dq0/palantir_225m_contract_with_japan/,159,"DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 28, 2020, it was awarded a $22.5 million, one-year contract in partnership with SOMPO Holdings for the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing”. SOMPO’s visionary Real Data Platform, or “RDP” is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Japan, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, SOMPO and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir’s platforms and services in Japan. Already, Palantir Japan has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

SOMPO’s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Japanese commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Japanese industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of “real data” over the past few decades. For example, Japan alone has more than 60,000 elder care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with SOMPO at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between SOMPO and Palantir.

I never expected to be here, but I found myself in an awkward position as an individual who went all-in on $PLTR at its IPO in September. I did some 'research' after the huge run up and ended up here, with the meme stocks. Apperently, my senses happen to coincide with complete and utter autism. 

Since then, I have found the investor presentation from August for '$HCAC' aka '$GOEV' aka Canoo. I went in hard on the company, as I believe in the vision and direction, but I must admit I am discouraged with the recent downturn.

Does anyone have a solid reason for the downturn? Or have any input on thier own beliefs? I still believe in this company, but I have no idea why the crash happened, other than paper hands taking short-term profits.

Tldr: Why GOEV low? Why not high?

GME 4Q20 Financial Model Update,dd,438,0.94,krdqp5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/krdqp5/gme_4q20_financial_model_update/,221,"GME GANGGGG!!! Most of you know I've been long GameStop since 2017, initially. I am an OG GME bull and yearn for our true value to be recognized by the market. RC Ventures sees it. Many others (Senvest, Michael Burry, Hedgeye, etc.) do as well.

But Melvin Capital does not. They wish we would file for bankruptcy so they can just escape this trade. Alas, they didn't close when the price was $2.57. Greed will be their downfall. But, they are smart. They see the data and for that reason I must enlighten you all about what I am seeing in the data, too. Remember though, one quarter doesn't make or break this thesis.

GameStop 4Q results will be weak, barring a spontaneous console creation event. Holiday results will be weak. The reality is while the future may be brighter than the wasteland the Melvin perceives for GME, the present isn't so great being at your core primarily a B&M retailer. It doesn't matter how in demand your products are if supply isn't there. I placed more notes in the image.

The reality is the order rate had been excellent earlier in the quarter and had been tapering for some time, spiking when resupply events occurred. I had trimmed my estimates previously, but given the continued slowing of the order rate (\~62k/day to start January) and viewing some US CC data that reflects a slowing sales performance as the quarter went on, it is my duty to share my belief that the forthcoming Holiday results will not be that strong. As I noted in my last post, there was also embedded console resupply included in my January base case, I have removed that assumption, too.

But let's not get too upset, fellow \*\*\*. While Melvin and its army of bankruptcy believers will spew forth vitriol claiming how weak sales prove nO oNe ShOpS aT gAmEsToP, the truth is they know what is coming from RC Ventures and will look to use any entrance of retail shorts into the trade as a means of  supply purchasing their shares from to cover some. The price may retrace if this proves true, however the reality is RC Ventures has bought at $16, and will likely deem a price under the 50 day MA as an excellent buying opportunity especially if they clearly communicate to the market that the reason for the price appreciation is Ryan Cohen, not George Sherman.

Look, it's a chess match, take the DD aside and think about it. Management reported 3Q and shares tanked. Ryan Cohen bought, and can be seen by observers as the primary catalyst for the upside move. Now, management will report Holiday Sales (and whatever else they have in mind at ICR \[I view a strategic partnership or a smallish technology oriented M&A play as my base case\]) and the price will likely dip next week. Do you believe Ryan Cohen won't take the opportunity to ramp his position up another 2% to 14.9% if the price dips below $15? He will file on Form 4 within two business days and show himself to be the savior, once again. I am speculating, but given the clear preference of WSB, Twitter, and StockTwits for #WeWantCohen its safe to say that retail is on his side. He will likely gather more votes under his own power and from those in alignment with his viewpoint. A forthcoming board slate would be publicized in early March. This is a war, always has been.

Play tactically if you wish, or 💎 ✋. I would advise against FD buying (in almost all cases, but especially this time). Here's the model.

I'd rather tell it like it is (as the data informs me) rather than put out BS. Hopefully I'm overly conservative. Call me \*\*\* if you must, but I'll own GME longer than 99% of you. Still have a price target of \~$100 by 2023. Cheers

Options vs Futures RR,question,14,0.86,krfha2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/krfha2/options_vs_futures_rr/,34,"It seems that unless your a pro, trading options can put you at huge disadvantage vs trading futures, assuming the leverage is not needed, for example on a call spread capital risked is higher than the potential reward, on futures you can set a stop loss to have the same risk but upside and time is not limited. The only possible advantage for options is there's no stop loss to trigger if the stock fall before it goes back up but this advantage would be offset by futures not limiting profits on a price swing the other way. So it looks like with stocks and futures probability of profit/loss is more constant and fixed to near 50/50 with the chances of market move up or down, but with options probability of loss can be much higher than profit depending on how well you know how to trade options. is this correct?

Another point, some people say not to put stop loss on options which makes sense because the option  is already risk limited and you would lose the no stop trigger advantage but very few people would wait for profits equal to 100% so your always risking more than profit target, not many people trading futures would set a stop loss greater then their profit target. 

New to trading and was wondering if I should be trading futures instead of options, are these points correct or is there some advantage that evens things out that I'm not thinking about?",2021-01-06 11:42:08,

Personally, I could see this dropping to 500 by EoD. Regardless I think this could be a good buying opportunity. I'm probably going to wait until the last second to take a position if I do.

Why $QQQJ isn't done - YUUUUUGE POTENTIAL,dd,211,0.95,kscrx2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kscrx2/why_qqqj_isnt_done_yuuuuuge_potential/,88,"Tired of seeing ICLN and TAN posts and feeling FOMO because you missed the rocketship ETF? Well, look no further than QQQJ, an ETF which tracks the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Index (the next 100 NASDAQ companies after the ones in QQQ). 🚀🚀🚀

As expectations for an economic recovery increase due to the incoming Biden administration, we should see continued growth in the stocks that comprise QQQJ, more so than the large-caps that comprise QQQ. This evidence can be seen by backtesting data provided on the NASDAQ website, which compares the performance of QQQJ against other mid-cap fund performance.

&#x200B;

[Back-tested 1-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/0vpf5800yw961.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=209a318c5e67a98e8609022c2c2ffd6034485856)

Some of its more well-known holdings include recently beat-down companies such as:

* ROKU (down 5% from December highs)
* TTD (down 20% from December highs)
* BYND (down 18% from December highs)
* DKNG (down 10% from December highs)

Despite this beatdown of its more famous holdings, it's still almost back to pre-December crash highs. More importantly, the premiums on its calls are still lower compared to other similarly priced ETFs.

The incoming volatility from the swearing in of a new president should also cause an IV spike.

But won't growth be limited because companies will move into QQQ as soon as they grow? Not necessarily - in a bull market, all stonks go up, including those in QQQ. If all stonks are going up, then everyone wins, but QQQJ wins more.

# More confirmation bias:

Below is some historic data showing what happens when we have a Democratic president and a split or Republican-led Congress. Combine this with the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc, and QQQJ rocket confirmed.

# Charts

I've done some rudimentary crayon analysis on Tradingview, and as you all can see, we should see QQQJ at 35 sometime around March. This is based on the most bearish analysis I could find based on its current trend and macroeconomic conditions. As you can see, it's shown relatively stable growth thus far (aside from the crash in December).

[Rudimentary Bearish Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/jdhzylf4yw961.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b75e4174338e6161bf7467950f3512f840f3319)

Alternatively, we could see hyper growth as the stocks in the Next Gen 100 Index rally based on an optimistic outlook from the potential redo of the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc. Below is my best bull-case TA drawing:

# HERE'S THE KEY POINT

Some of QQQJ's holdings recently suffered major beatdowns and are poised for recovery.

Premiums are higher than they were two weeks ago but still undervalued compared to similarly priced ETFs. June 35cs are going for $1.10 right now.

Based on my ~~astrology~~ TA predictions, these should be ITM by March/April, at which time you can either sell the calls or just exercise them and sell the shares.

The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot & Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the day, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small & mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy & [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new & improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, & SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney & Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs & EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba & Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

Have a great day and see you next time!",2021-01-07 21:03:51,

#[Today's Top Headlines for Thursday, January 7th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-7-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday’s record despite Capitol turmoil

> * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high despite the turmoil at the Capitol. Early Thursday, outgoing President Donald Trump said in a statement there “will be an orderly transition” of power, shortly after Congress confirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s win.

> * Economists expect an increase in initial jobless claims, when the Labor Department reports its weekly numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. With the seven-day average of new daily U.S. Covid infections spiking to a record high, first-time filings for unemployment benefits are seen rising by 28,000 to 815,000 for the week ended Jan. 2.

> * Ahead of Friday’s government employment report, the ADP’s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

> * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

> * The world’s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

> * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump’s statement, which promised “an orderly transition on January 20th,” the day of Biden’s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

> * Congress’ process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

*****

> # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‘seriously consider’ invoking 25th Amendment

> * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to “seriously consider” invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

> * Members of Trump’s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

> * An administration official confirmed to CNBC’s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

> * Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

> # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

> * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock’s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden’s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

It appears factually wrong unless there was a another 1b$ dilution, which according to SEC filings I think there actually was!  If they issued $1b of stock, then the dilution is insane.

Here are the numbers for stock issuance per the quarterly filings.  I saw more recent filings on the SEC website:

The debate about large Canadian companies vs multi-state operators is also interesting.

4 Steel Stocks Set to Gain on Spurred Up Demand in 2021

Mentioned:	MT RYI SC.HN ZEUS

The steel industry in the United States now seems poised to make a comeback from the COVID-19 led slump during the earlier part of last year. Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.

Moreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week’s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.

Reflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager’s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.

Meanwhile, the World Steel Association (“worldsteel”) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.

Separately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.

4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now

The outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand. Meanwhile, production of light vehicles is also expected to rebound in 2021, a development that bodes well for the steel industry. This makes it a good time to invest in steel stocks that stand to benefit from this improved outlook. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

ArcelorMittal MT, along with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. The company sells its products to various customers in the automotive, appliance, engineering, construction, energy and machinery industries through a centralized marketing organization, as well as distributors. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 62.2% over the past 60 days.

"Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the ENPH for 2021🚀 Hope you listened last time - Still lots of room for huge gains - warrants, calls, commons",dd,32,0.83,kseo3o,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kseo3o/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_enph/,40,"This is my second post for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. Hope you fuckers listened last time  
   
\*I have to actually spell out the company name because this dumb subreddit thinks its still a spac (its not and hasn’t been since 2018). The ticker is just the first letter of each word

Hopefully you listened to me last time:  
 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure\_and\_energy\_alternative\_is\_the\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/)

You probably didn’t and chased some shitty call option that failed.

At the time of that post Infrastructure and Energy Alternative commons were at $11.30 and warrants at $1.50. Commons now are tickling $20 (almost double) and warrants around 4 (2.5x gain). Not bad.

You’re probably wondering why I would still recommend Infrastructure and Energy Alternative after the nice run it has had recently. Well, with 2bn in revenue and now with the dems taking Georgia, we are going to see TRILLIONS of dollars pour into green energy this year and onwards. The best part is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative still sits at a paltry 420mm market cap (less than 0.25x revenue). 

Yesterday you saw all 3 othet green energy stocks: Cleanspark, FCEL and PLUG run 30% even though all 3 are already madly overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the best deal of the 3 and still has a ton of room to run. It is clear that green energy is going to boom this year.

Motley fool had an interesting mention of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative today too:  
 [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/)

I know you won’t click the link to read it but here is the important part  
 

*Indeed, Infrastructure & Energy Alternatives just might turn out to be the most promising of these three stock opportunities. Although the company reported only $13.2 million in net profit over the past 12 months according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that number is more than twice what Infrastructure and Energy Alternative earned last year. Moreover, free cash flow generation at Infrastructure and Energy Alternative was a very robust $68.6 million over the past year. At a market capitalization of just $410 million, that works out to an ultra-cheap price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than six.*

*Almost entirely uncovered on Wall Street, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives could be the small-cap stock to watch in 2021.*

Best part, like they just mentioned, is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is STILL NOT DISCOVERED BY WALL STREET. This is still ground floor. Potential ENPH type move in 2021 for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. 🚀

If you look at the Infrastructure and Energy Alternative chart, there is a very obvious pattern that has been happening since summer. It moons roughly 80-100% then dips 30% and consolidates… rinse and repeat. It looks like it just finished its recent consolidation in the 16-17 area and is ready for its next leg up to $30.

Funds have been adding mad in the most recent consolidation period between $15-$17. The volume is regularly over 1million now when just a month ago it was a struggle to hit 500-700k. It is clear that funds are starting to find Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. It was also recently added to a few ETF’s and index’s. 

IMO Infrastructure and Energy Alternative will see $30 relatively soon. $30 on the commons gives us $10 warrants. When you hit the $10 warrants (or whatever price youre happy with) you can then flip then into the commons and let them ride throughout 2021.

You can obviously buy calls but I think warrants are the better deal here for the potential 100% move + in the short and midterm.

P.s. read through my previous wsb post (link at the top) if youre interested in the deeper numbers regarding Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. This is ENPH for 2021 baby.

Lemonade (LMND) am I missing something DD,,20,0.83,ksxfnj,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksxfnj/lemonade_lmnd_am_i_missing_something_dd/,59,"So I was scrolling through tickers tonight and came by Lemonade (LMND) it was in my watch list at the beginning IPO and kind of through it out sometime in October. Then I saw it was at 150$ plus today and was like what is up with this. Based on articles with 1 million subscribers and huge growth and all this doesn’t make any sense and I swear this company is going to drop hard. 

Quick Math: They reached one million subscribers this year. They will have a projected revenue of $93 million for 2020 when next quarter results come out.

They are making on average $93 per customer as an insurance company per year based on “1 million” subs. That is $7.75 per month for customer. That is cheaper than streaming services and they have to pay out claims. 

Compare this to Netflix: 
1 Million Subs for Lemonade: Market Cap-8.5 Billion
200 Millions Subs for Netflix - Market Cap-225 Billion

Based off subscribers/market cap ratio if Lemonade got 200 million they would be worth 1.7 trillion. Also, based on there current revenue per customer they would be hauling in 1.5 billion as a 1.7 trillion company.

So in other words, this company can’t and won’t succeed and their has to be some misleading of investors with the financials. I don’t get how they have a million subs and only 93 million and revenue. There is no chance they can make a profit by doing this and by the way they haven’t. 

Side note: CEO and Directors offloaded about half of their shares in December. From about 180,000 to 90,000 for about $120 a pop.",2021-01-08 15:08:59,
Phat DD on constipated flight centre,dd,3,0.64,ksy21u,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksy21u/phat_dd_on_constipated_flight_centre/,6,"ASX: FLT

Bullish case: 

Flight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there’s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that’s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia’s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021’s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don’t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don’t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can’t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). 

This also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. 

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud


So my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)

So I’m, with my very limited knowledge, guessing that ICLN will dump their PLUG profits into their only wind holding: Vestas

2) why is the ticker I’m seeing (VWDRY) different from the one iShares lists
3) I was told that this is a foreign stock in the form of an American Depository Reciept (ADR) so I can’t buy calls, but why isn’t that the case for something like BABA and will that ever change?
4) are there any other wind stocks that might be better? of course, I’m hedging on the cycle of ICLN dumping into this, the stock rising because everyone else buys too, and then ICLN buying more to keep up with demand, but there could be other options",2021-01-08 16:17:14,

The  Indian Steel Association (ISA) calls for a 6 month ban on iron ore exports. India is the fourth largest iron ore producer in the world. [Source](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/top-iron-ore-producing-countries/#:~:text=Global%20iron%20ore%20production%20jumped,0.5%25%20for%20the%20following%20decade)

This is just the latest showcase of the massive iron ore shortage the world is facing in the wake of the pandemic. Governments everywhere announced/will announce massive infrastructure plans to spur on the economy.

With India possibly out of exporting, iron ore prices can only go up, meaning other iron ore producers are set to profit massively. The last time iron ore prices where this high VALE was at almost $40 (+100% upside from today)

VALE is also fundamentally undervalued compared to its competitors, other miners are trading at 2X the EPS of VALE, again confirming our price target of high 30's. The reason VALE stock price is suppressed is an accident last year at one of their dams. VALE is still negotiating a deal with the Brazilian government but expectations are that this will be behind them soon.

Let's get down to business; it's time to get stupid wasted off twea's and truly's like our wives to cope with our losses.  Instead of buying that FD for Tesla next week, get one on Apple instead & spend the rest on a few cases of booze to drink while apple fucks you and then goes up 10 points.

The viral video of loser white guy getting fatality'd with a can of tea sent shockwaves through the meme community.  Saw a string of videos on tiktok of people dramatically opening a briefcase and pulling out a twisted tea like they're boutta air out the scene with a glizzy.  And that was just **ONE** of the chain of free advertising videos, made sometimes and reposted often by kids who *didn't/can't/don't* even drink TT or alcohol.  That girl on Twitter has posted multiple times about how this event already is and will continue to affect her work schedule for the coming month.

Alllll kinds of search trends exploded for ""Twisted Tea"" and ""Sam Adams"".  Someone posted a week or so ago with screenshots of different explosive search trends, tried finding that post and their account but failed at both (like most things in life).  EDIT—u/Altruistic_report105 posted it 3 days ago, fuckin go nuts n look at the good data he posted.

Not to mention the fact that Sam Adams is a high volume stock, trading healthily at almost exactly a grand a share, and they **fucking murdered** their last two earnings.  They crushed 2019 in sales & are currently set up by meme power and alcoholics normalizing their problems to kill another earnings report, coming 2/17 after hours.  

Why is the meme power so important?  Why is this sudden late boost in sales so important?

**Because the dusty old millionaire shareholders aren't on social media and have no clue about the true potential because they play sudoku on paper and thus aren't pricing in the coming action.**

I'm not saying that Sam Adam's doing good is gonna be news to them; but every single time the big dollars are aware of a catalyst and possible positive price action change backed by a strong financial quarter, they price that in for options and then our lottery calls are too expensive and risky to play.

Enough bullshit, lets get down to it.  Before i open my positions, im gonna try and grab some extra money quick trading NIO calls as NIO Day is saturday and should give a small run up friday.

Here are my positions; starting off by selling a short spread, taking the credit, and doubling it down into 2 poor mans calls.  If your primary language is retard i can translate---Me sell shit position and buy 2 good ones!

\-1 $SAM 2/19 1050p, +1 $SAM 2/19 1040p

\-1 $SAM 2/19 1050c,  +1 $SAM 2/19 1040c    x2

Gonna be in it for about a grand, and out for 2 in profits for a total of 3.

5% over the next 5 weeks with a strong catalyst backing it should be an easy task for the big dog to pull off & it will be just in time to make my annual car payment on the 21st ;) wish a fellow retard some luck and drink some tea's for me!",2021-01-08 17:29:38,

I know this week has been hard, but I think we all know this will pay off. Hopefully you all took this week as an opportunity to average down, if you got caught buying at $20 a share. Also I got my dad to purchase 1000 shares right before close, and he said I’m getting the belt if this goes tits up. But on to the important part...

Basically I was browsing the internet, bored as shit with the markets being closed, and found this gem of a detail, that I was completely unaware of. I’ve been long GME, mostly because of daddy Cohen, but this is just one more reason why I’m 💎✋🤚s on this beautiful stock. 

This news might be old, but as someone who looks at all the DD, I was surprised to see it. 

To keep it short, (hahaha fuck Melvin) basically GameStop has a partnership with Microsoft, and gets a percentage of digital game sales, and other digital purchases, if the console was purchased at GameStop. That means that all these new consoles that just keep on selling out at GameStop, will keep generating revenue for years to come, even if customers don’t come and buy games. 

Article: https://gamingstreet.com/hold-or-sell-gamestop-the-digital-shift-vs-a-new-microsoft-partnership/

TL;DR GameStop can still capture digital sales through partnerships.

Why market moves(long),question,158,0.93,ktjfsq,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktjfsq/why_market_moveslong/,62,"To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, don't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons or other reasons.

Edit: for clarification, this is not the only type of passive investment ETFs. In fact, some will sell if the stock rises.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, ""Brrrr"".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, ""Brrr"". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

I posted this one before but it got removed by votebots.",2021-01-09 12:01:50,

$51000 in a weekly Lithium mining play $LAC,dd,82,0.92,ktk2yu,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktk2yu/51000_in_a_weekly_lithium_mining_play_lac/,129,"What a week **$LAC** had this week. I rode my $12.5 calls expiring in February until the market open this morning and immediately transferred them into $20 calls expiring the 15th, next Friday.

**News:**

* ^(One of those, the Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project in Nevada,) **is expected to be approved on Jan. 15, according to an official at the Bureau of Land Management.**
* “**It’s been a good, collaborative process with state and federal authorities. We look forward to the decision**,” ^(said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas, which has been developing the project for more than a decade. Lithium is a key component of electric vehicle batteries.)
* **Administration officials tell Reuters** ^(they plan to publish a raft of decisions on Jan. 15 that will expand miners’ access to federal lands), **give final approval to Lithium Americas Corp’s Nevada lithium mine** ^(and approve a land swap for a Rio Tinto Ltd Arizona copper mining project, among other steps.)

**Notes about the Thacker Pass Project:**

* Located in Nevada
* Nevada has recently run out of unemployment funding due to COVID and has asked for federal loans. Nevada WILL NOT deny lithium-based revenue from companies like $LAC and have already approved tax incentives for them.
* Training of local workers for land development has already begun. Jobs are already created and filled. 
* The Thacker Pass is the largest known Lithium deposit in the US and 2nd largest globally 

This is truly revolutionary in the EV and lithium-based mining. As we all know EV companies have been on an absolute run lately as well as all lithium companies.

It had a nice pullback today and consolidated at $18.50 before closing at $19.33. Expect this to absolutely run next week to $25-30.

**Price Targets for next Friday:**

* $25-30
* This would put the $20 calls at $5-10 from a 1.25 entry

**Final note:** 

* Stocks only go up
* It's an EV play

AAPL Earnings DD and iPhone 12 Sales Estimates,dd,104,0.96,ku0e2j,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ku0e2j/aapl_earnings_dd_and_iphone_12_sales_estimates/,130,"TLDR: My autistic senses say Apple will beat earnings bigly on strong iPhone sales and higher av. selling price. AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print

Positions: AAPL 132c 2/5

https://preview.redd.it/2pzvjv51gca61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3ec55f5d2209e731ffad991bf518f2c1e4fcec1

Over the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Any retard could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133. 

A few articles from shills and morons below

[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)

[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)

I did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.

 Analysts expect a[38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales. 

Additionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at. 

Using availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.

https://preview.redd.it/quqwmg5mmda61.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3607de4af73989b6e35274c26bf82fd1a68dad

 Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call. 

**Positions**

\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.

 I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play. 

If you buy puts fuck you.

On top of that I just have that autistic little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. Being such an autist, I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out. And lets face it, you've yolo'ed on more retarded DD before.

$SNOW play,question,5,0.69,kuh53g,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuh53g/snow_play/,23,"A while ago I submitted this post:
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0bo5b/short_squeeze_on_snow/

Obviously this play failed catastrophically. Fortunately enough for me I didn't get completely burnt as I got some 350 puts when it hits 400. So I am still up a bit from snow plays.

I got burnt again second time for the second lock up, which was on Thursday last week. Funny enough I did sort of see it coming, because the second lock up was from pre-ipo investors. Not the snowflake employees who would dump every share at the market open. They probably would sell off slowly to not cause a panic.

I panicked a bit when it hit above 310 last Friday as it looks like it is about to go back to test 340s. But it showed a lot of weakness mid day, so it does appears that pre-ipo investors are slowly dumping their stakes.

I am wondering where would the mm find liquidity. There were definitely liquidity at around 300 level, not sure if there are much at 350 price level, since there are bag holders up there so they would face some selling pressure as well. Based on the movement friday, I felt like the liquidity is running dry above 300s, and it is probably going to 250s very soon or 230 where there should be plenty of people who are willing to hold their bags.

My question is that do you own any stake in snowflake? Why would anyone buy or not sell at this price range? I don't see a lot of hype here or on other reddit subs. I did see some hypes on stocktwits and twitter. Some people pointed out unusual call option buying activity at $360. But that happened when the stock price was at 320s, the premium quickly faded. Not sure what to think about that.

"They'll have to prize my GME shares out of my cold, dead, perfectly formed hands",question,857,0.96,kuhaca,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhaca/theyll_have_to_prize_my_gme_shares_out_of_my_cold/,192,"I want to add to the GME backlash-backlash by explaining why I'll never sell my shares as long as Ryan Cohen is in. I'm a bit older than a lot of you weirdos, and us Gen Xers might have an extra perspective on the GME saga that I haven't seen mentioned that often.

I remember **Pets.com,** and there's no reason why I should because I was busy going to raves and dropping E or whatever (i.e. studying). But I do remember it, because it was hard to miss. In 1998-99 it exploded as this dazzling symbol of everything that was vibrant and excitingly fucking totally mental about the dot.com boom. Amazon threw money at the startup, it had an enormous media presence and apparently a great online store, and it raised over $80 million on the NASDAQ (I looked at Wiki for that).

And then Pets.com so entirely and rapidly collapsed that it became a laughing stock for years. FOR YEARS. The parody ad that was aired during the 2001 Super Bowl was only the start. I don't live in the US (we couldn't even buy from the company over here), but I remember everyone laughing their heads off over the mess that was Pets.com.

And in the following years, when people were still wiping their eyes from crying or laughing at this god-awful lesson, Ryan Cohen was thinking about setting up.....a fucking online pet store. It should have been the last thing anyone would have wanted to touch. From my own limited DD, the granddaddy of US pet companies, Petsmart, had been a B&M store for about 15 years already, and the difficulties it experienced from 1996 meant it wasn't exactly a guiding light either.

So the 25-year-old Ryan Cohen decided to open Chewy and was abruptly - and logically - turned down by 100 investors. They smiled politely and ran a mile. But according to Cohen, he **'moved forward and never changed his business strategy'** despite having 100 doors closed in his face. Eventually, one of those investors got back to himself and cofounder Michael Day and said they liked the numbers and would throw a bit of money at the new company.

Cohen and Day proceeded to turn Chewy into a behemoth. Less than one year after being founded, Chewy had revenues of $26 million, though it was losing money, and then from 2014 to 2015 it grew from $205 million to $423 million, due to its focus on customer service and emotional connection etc. We all know about Petsmart buying the outfit for **$3.5 Billion** in 2017, only six years after starting up.

This whole story is the thing that sticks in my head, more than any hope of a squeeze or the likelihood of a slow, long turnaround under the current board.

And Cohen's latest tweet about the roller-coaster only adds to my possibly demented thinking, because in his keynote speech he gave to the Florida Venture Capital Conference in 2018, he compared growing a business to having a child, saying,

'It is a huge act of selflessness and dedication and if you are ready for it, **it is going to be a crazy,  crazy, crazy roller-coaster and it will be the journey of a lifetime.'**

So, to people looking at the excellent but pessimistic technical analysis, the gloomy outlook over the upcoming earnings and the conference tomorrow, and the hit pieces that are popping up at the moment like wildfire, you can shove them up your hole.

Ryan Cohen has a screw loose, and I'm betting on that beautiful screw.

$AMZN: DD on Earnings EPS and Estimates,dd,43,0.89,kuhamy,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhamy/amzn_dd_on_earnings_eps_and_estimates/,40,"Amazon is due for the breakout. It did a big try beforce christmas but came back down. They haven't released the christmas sales informations, what they usually do. My guess is they will either do it soon or keep them for earnings.

Chrismas must have been absolut gigantic for Papa Bezos. Last Q4 they had a 62% earnings surprise and rose 8,11% after earnings.

Now Corona hit us and we all know people spend a lot more time online shopping then usual! Appstore sales (Apple) were off the roof and Amazon will have the same for sure.

**2020 v 2019 (Coronabonus for online sales and AWS)**

&#x200B;

||2019|2020|Growth YoY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Q4|6.47|||
|Q3|4.23|12.37|192.43%|
|Q2|5.22|10.3|97.32%|
|Q1|7.09|5.01|\-29.34%|

Now in Q1 2020 Amazon invested a lot in safety for their emploees and in last mile delivery. As you can see these investements made huge gains YoY and I wouldnt be surprised if the make more than 200% YoY in Q4! Chrismas was stay at home and let it deliver. 600$ Stimulus went straight in Amazon.

&#x200B;

The EPS estimate for Q4 2020 is 6.97. If we take the 6.47 (Q4 2019 and apply the growth we guess you can see the real estimate here:

&#x200B;

|0%|50%|100%|200%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|6.47|9.70|12.94|19.41|

So if the only grow about 20% they will have the estimate. Would you guess they grow earnings for 20% YoY? I would make a wild guess for 150-200%

If that is true we could see an epic 10-15% move of the stock after earnings. Q4 2019 disrupted the stock and pushed it 8% higher and the surprice was only 60%. If you take the 200% Growth YoY Q4 it would surprise by 300% which could lead to absolute new ATHs.

My estimate: 150% YoY Q4, which bringt earnings to **16,175 EPS and a surprise of 232%**(!!!!)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: BUY AMAZON! Amazon 3.800-4.000 MAY CONFIRMED** **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

Positon: 150 Stock and will buy 3800 weelies before the earnings (2/4/21)

The United States is the world’s single largest economy (at market exchange rates), accounting for almost 22 percent of global output and over a third of stock market capitalization. It is prominent in virtually every global market, accounting for about one-tenth of global trade flows, one-fifth of global FDI stock, close to one-fifth of remittances, and one-fifth of global energy demand. Since the U.S. dollar is the most widely used currency in global trade and financial transactions, changes in U.S. monetary policy and investor sentiment play a major role in driving global financing conditions.

What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings & PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).

We saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary & Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small & mid-caps have outperformed.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba & MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.

In [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla & TSM.

We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.

While December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.

So, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.

This week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.

So, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don’t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:

They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.

They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.

The “new battery technology” that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla’s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the “New Solid-State battery” the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.

And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.

Also, I don’t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn’t competition for TESLA 3, it’s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla’s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).

But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla’s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn’t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.

So, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But… I am disappointed in the “new battery technology” and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla & NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it’s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.

On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.

And don’t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don’t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points

I could be just guessing though, so insight is welcome. Where is that NVAX SME?

# GameStop Says Total 2020 Holiday Sales Declined 3.1%

# GameStop Reports 2020 Holiday Sales Results

GRAPEVINE, Texas, Jan. 11, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **GameStop Corp. (NYSE:**[**GME**](https://pro.benzinga.com/stock/GME#NYSE)**),** today reported worldwide sales results for the nine-week holiday period ended January 2, 2021 reflecting a 4.8% increase in comparable store sales and a 309% increase in E-Commerce sales.  Total sales declined 3.1% driven by an 11% decrease in the company's store base due to its planned de-densification strategy, temporary store closures around the world due to government mandates and lower store traffic, particularly later in December, due to the significant impacts of COVID-19.  The Company believes the industry-wide traffic decline during the Holiday period adversely impacted comparable sales for the nine-week period in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage point range.  In addition, significant worldwide supply chain constraints impacted the ability to distribute products to customers across all sales channels.  However, the Company experienced unprecedented demand for recently launched gaming consoles, and while consumer demand far outpaced constrained supply in the nine-week period, the Company believes these products will drive sales well into 2021 as console availability from our suppliers improves later in the year.   
 

**Holiday Sales (the nine-week period ended January 2, 2021 compared to the nine-week period ended January 4, 2020)**

* **Total comparable store sales** increased 4.8% compared to last year and reflected a 29.6 percentage point sequential improvement from the third quarter of fiscal 2020.  These positive results were adversely impacted in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage point range, as a result of a significant reduction in consumer traffic related to the increase in COVID-19 cases;
* **Net sales** were $1.770 billion, a 3.1% decrease compared to 2019, as strong console demand was offset by store closures under the Company's planned de-densification strategy, temporary store closures mandated by local governments due to COVID-19, and industry-wide limited supply of new gaming consoles, and supply chain constraints broadly;
* **E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company's $1.0 billion growth objective;
* **Regional Sales,** in Australia/New Zealand, where the Company's operations were materially less impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, total comparable sales for the nine-week period increased approximately 31%, outperforming the Company's other operating regions.

George Sherman, GameStop's chief executive officer said, ""GameStop maintained its status as the omni-channel destination for gaming and entertainment with unprecedented demand for the new gaming consoles and a significant increase in E-Commerce sales.  Demand for the new generation of consoles remains very strong, and as a result, we anticipate the consumer's excitement for the new console technology will benefit us going forward well through 2021.  We reported a 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, including over 300% increase in E-Commerce sales reflecting demand for new consoles, continued strength for Nintendo Switch and our expanded gaming product assortment. While E-Commerce sales contributed approximately 34% of total sales for the first nine weeks of the fourth quarter, our sales growth progression also includes an adverse impact to comparable transactions related to the meaningful drop in retail traffic during the holiday sales season due to an increase in COVID-19 cases around the world.""

Mr. Sherman continued, ""Overall, we remain confident in both the positive growth aspects for 2021 driven by our strategy to add new and exciting product revenue streams across all things games and entertainment and the strong demand for the new generation for console-based video game products  We look forward to executing on both of these areas in 2021 to expand our addressable market and product offerings supported by the many exciting opportunities to leverage our brand, extensive loyalty member base, and improving digital capabilities.""   

**Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020 Outlook (13 weeks ending January 30, 2021)**  


The Company continues to focus on efforts that position it to manage through this unprecedented time, including maintaining its balance sheet strength, prioritizing the allocation of resources to areas of the business that produce strong cash flow, reducing expenses across the business, developing and expanding its digital strategy, and intensifying inventory discipline. Due to the uncertainty around the duration and evolving impact of COVID-19, the Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however, unless further unforeseen COVID-19 related impacts occur, it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter.   

The Company anticipates reporting fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020 results in late March.

Post #2 Tuesday: I have a discount trading bot which gives out daily/hourly discounts for the stock market. Here’s what the bot stated under discounted companies...,question,140,0.93,kvlpjb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvlpjb/post_2_tuesday_i_have_a_discount_trading_bot/,58,"Tuesday, 12 January 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

**First Post:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i\_have\_a\_discount\_trading\_bot\_which\_gives\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuwg1e/i_have_a_discount_trading_bot_which_gives_out/)

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help /r/wallstreetbets. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

&#x200B;

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.

&#x200B;

**Key:**

* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

Let's look at ICLN and the Clean Energy Market's very near future,dd,225,0.95,kvo9dd,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvo9dd/lets_look_at_icln_and_the_clean_energy_markets/,84,"The [iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ICLN?p=ICLN&.tsrc=fin-srch) is pretty much the most popular Clean Energy ETF right now. Why? Because it's going to the fucking moon with this administration. Here's why.

&#x200B;

A democratic President, Senate, and Congress are all taking office soon. The Biden administration had already publicized their plans for climate change and Clean Energy back before the election, saying ""[Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, setting us on an irreversible course to meet the ambitious climate progress that science demands.](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)"" Our man Biden is literally pumping money into climate action, which will include a variety of benefits for the entire Clean Energy industry.

&#x200B;

Now, even more interesting, is that in the same article, the administration also says they plan to ""move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.""

&#x200B;

Let's look at the numbers from [eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) based on the most recent (2019) statistics:

&#x200B;

|Energy Source|Billion kWh|Share of Total %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Total - All Sources|4127|100.0%|
|Fossil Fuels (total)|2582|**62.6%**|
|Natural Gas|1586|^(38.4%)|
|Coal|965|^(23.4%)|
|Petroleum|18|^(0.4%)|
|Other Gases|13|^(0.3%)|
|Nuclear|809|^(19.6%)|
|Renewables (total)|728|**17.6%**|
|Wind|295|^(7.1%)|
|Hydropower|288|^(7.0%)|
|Solar|72|^(1.7%)|
|Biomass (total)|58|**1.4%**|
|Wood|39|^(0.9%)|
|Landfill gas|10|^(0.3%)|
|Municipal solid waste|6|^(0.1%)|
|Other biomass|2|^(0.1%)|
|Geothermal|15|^(0.4%)|
|Pumped storage Hydropower|\-5|^(-0.1%)|
|Other Sources|13|^(0.3%)|

&#x200B;

Looking at the numbers from 2019 relative to the 15 year target for the US energy sector, the entire Renewables sector will need to grow at an average rate of \~5% annually for the next 15 years in order to meet that target.

&#x200B;

Does that mean your stonks are only growing 5% annually? No, because 5% never got anyone to the moon. [5% of the US Energy Sector is equivalent to $17.5 Billion annually](https://www.selectusa.gov/energy-industry-united-states#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20International%20Energy,%2Dlargest%20in%20the%20world). That doesn't include the massive amounts of jobs that will be produced as the Clean Energy market rapidly develops. That also doesn't include the additional trillions of dollars that the coming administration intends to continue pumping out.

&#x200B;

The next big thing to look forward to is Biden's Inaugural Address, where I expect significant mentions of his plan to handle climate change and boost clean energy. Following that of course will be all of the big moves to pass this initial $2 trillion bill.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Are you thinking that ICLN doesn't have enough exposure to the EV market to ride along with TSLA and NIO?

Take a look at [First Trust Clean Edge Green Energy Index (QCLN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCLN?p=QCLN&.tsrc=fin-srch). It has maintained significant holdings in both NIO and TSLA throughout this wild ride.

&#x200B;

Still not convinced to dump your life savings into Clean Energy?

Maybe check out [Invesco Global Clean Energy (PBD)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBD?p=PBD&.tsrc=fin-srch). It's got great diversity within the Clean Energy sector, without concentrating too much on any single stock.

However, others have argued that there should be more stocks included in such a hypothetical.

I hereby propose an alternative BECKY index that includes more companies, and I would like to request WSB to comment on this proposal. Here are the considerations:

1. It assumes the normal consumption habits of a Becky in 2019 and before, and that COVID could not wipe out gyms and malls.
2. It assumes that these items are less likely to be purchased by Chads, Zhangs, or Robots (see ([u/Su-Bae-Bae's research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8d5uy/bcky_index_chad_index_zhng_index_rbot_index/) and [u/elons\_cybertruck's research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edazey/introducing_the_official_tonks_and_becky_trackers/) for reference).

I haven’t got much invested (10k give or take) but I’m getting more interested everyday. I am not an experienced trader by any means, my question is - do you really need the technical knowledge and numbers to succeed in the market? 

I usually just buy for long term for companies/industry that I think will succeed. (ICLN, PLTR, AMD) for example.

Well I'm here to do some diligent DD for you autists to YOLO your life savings into and upgrade the depressing life you live in.

**The company is Sony $SNE**. 

Some important things to know:

* Sony dominates in 3 major markets; Consumer electronics, entertainment, and telecommunications
* Recently, Sony raised its future earnings outlook on [record-breaking earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/sonys-second-quarter-profit-jumps-13point9percent-on-strong-gaming-demand.html)
* Current P/E ratio sits at around 14, with a historic high of 127 (peaking in PS2 release and averaging 80+ shortly after subsequent PS releases) industry average and competitors is currently at about 25.
* Sony also has [many predictable sources of revenue including](https://sonyreconsidered.com/sony-q1-2020-earnings-overview-revenue-2-profits-1-f467dafe5609) a ""Financial Services"" branch that advises anti-yolo boomer's assets.

Assuming you autists even read this far, lets get into what the future metrics for this might mean.

Lets start with the **Consumer Electronics or the cash guzzling brrrrr machine Playstation** segment. Currently if I want to buy a PS5 and throw my money at our King and money god Kenichiro Yoshida (CEO of Sony) I would have to go through 3rd party. When PS5's hit the market they sell faster than you retards can lose money. In fact, on average [PS5 is outselling Xbox 2-1](https://screenrant.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-series-x-reseller-website/) right now, in addition to that, the Brrrr-virus will cause the game console market to near [$55+ Billion next year](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/multi-billion-dollar-console-gaming-market/). Also, without getting into politics, its also important to know that approximately 10-20% of Stimmy checks will go to buying electronics based on polls. This segment is Sony's cash cow and makes up 30% of their revenue. This number is expected to grow significantly as more consoles are expected to hit the sales floor and is likely to [**exceed the PS2 RECORD 157m**](https://screenrant.com/ps5-order-sales-playstation-ps2-holiday-2020-preorder) **total consoles sold. 200 Million consoles = $90 Billion in sales!!** 🚀🚀🚀

Next is the **steady telecommunications segment; hey Boomers, this tendie stonks only go up segment is for you!** This is your home entertainment stuff like T.V.'s, speakers, solutions segments and mobile phone. They have a ton of patents on imaging and sensing products that they license out to keep revenues boring and flat here. This has been their worst performing segment during Covid and in a relatively fast response, they built the ""sony electronics corporation"", [rebranding their Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Mobile) brand with the goal of significantly decreasing operation costs and bandwagon onto the tech YOLO train.

Finally **the entertainment branch where you autists can laugh, cry, and most importantly tickle your tendies endlessly.** Not including the mad dash to get many licensed PS5 games, Sony's entertainment industry (Columbia pictures) is expected to release a new James Bond No Time to Die and Spiderman 3 in the coming year. Given the shutdown for the last year, the sales in entertainment decreased only 6% thanks to retards like Apple TV+ buying up licensing agreements for Sony's movies and shows. With upcoming hits, and a continued partnership with Apple TV+, revenues are going to quickly recover and even better than before.

**Tldr;** With the growth potential of PS5 alone, Sony should easily be trading at double its P/E of 14 to be closer to its competitors putting the PT at $200+. This does not include the massive shifts that they will be implementing across the org to increase net profits. 

**Tldr of the Tldr;**🌝🚀🌝🚀🌝🚀🌝🚀🌝🚀🌝🚀💸💸💸💸💸💸

Let's talk about the Oil Sector,dd,35,0.83,kw8dtm,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kw8dtm/lets_talk_about_the_oil_sector/,59,"The Oil Sector, just like everything else, has been impacted pretty heavily by the pandemic. Here I'm gonna discuss what's going on in the Oil Sector, and what that means for an investor/autist.

&#x200B;

Lets get some perspective.

&#x200B;

[Historical US Airline fuel consumption](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp).

Lets look at the totals for the last five years.

|Year|Consumption (US gallon)|Consumption Change YoY (%)|Cost|Cost Change YoY (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|17,044,700,000|1.88%|$24,654,000,000|\-19.95%|
|2017|17,295,300,000|1.47%|$29,251,600,000|18.65%|
|2018|17,868,300,000|3.31%|$38,462,800,000|31.49%|
|2019|18,269,000,000|2.24%|$36,457,100,000|\-5.21%|
|2020|9,359,600,000|\-44.01%|$13,353,300,000|\-59.96%|

&#x200B;

Consumption is down a significant amount, and based on [projections](https://www.statista.com/statistics/655057/fuel-consumption-of-airlines-worldwide/), it's not expected to make a full recovery in 2021. Airlines represent [7.8% of worldwide oil consumption](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/fuels-aviation-and-shipping). The world Oil Sector is valued at about [$3.3 trillion](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030915/what-percentage-global-economy-comprised-oil-gas-drilling-sector.asp).

&#x200B;

Even if airlines were to make a full operational recovery and begin flying at similar rates to peak years, airlines won't be able to generate the same revenue. Why? [Look at where their money comes from](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp). Major market-moving companies [have already announced that they plan to significantly reduce coming to work and travelling for business](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-asking-employees-to-work-from-home-due-to-coronavirus-2020#in-july-google-extended-its-employee-work-from-home-policy-through-june-2021-on-sunday-night-the-company-extended-that-policy-by-three-months-starting-in-september-2021-google-employees-will-go-back-to-the-office-part-time-working-a-minimum-of-three-days-in-the-office-and-the-rest-at-home-1). To add onto that, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html). The means regular tourism and travel won't be kicking off anytime soon in 2021.

&#x200B;

If you are really interested in taking a deep dive into prices for gas, take a look at consumer [fuel prices, futures, and supply](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/gasoline.php). To help you better understand and analyze this information, check out this [information on how gas is priced](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/gasoline/factors-affecting-gasoline-prices.php).

&#x200B;

""[The nature of the pandemic and social distancing makes weekly gasoline consumption a valuable proxy measure of economic and social activity](https://aei.ag/2020/09/21/the-most-interesting-chart-in-2020-u-s-gasoline-consumption/)."" In other words, gas consumption will rise once people can regularly get out of the house. As I mentioned before, the general US population isn't expected to start receiving a vaccine [until late summer](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/us/coronavirus-vaccine-general-public-states/index.html).

&#x200B;

Most important to note is that the [oil companies are actually working to maintain a good supply/demand ratio](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-producers-commit-to-supply-curbs-sustaining-price-rally-11610452802) in order to promote stability and growth in the sector.

&#x200B;

**Now lets not panic.** Why? Because oil is arguably the foundation of the global economy. People *go to fucking war* because they don't have enough of it.

&#x200B;

Looking at the  [SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOP?p=XOP&.tsrc=fin-srch). This ETF represents the trends of the major domestic companies that operate in the Exploration and Production sub-sector of the domestic energy market. Take a look at its [Holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/XOP/#holdings).

Here how things are looking with the prices:

&#x200B;

||Date|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Open|03 Jan 2020|$96.12|
|Pre-Crash|19 Feb 2020|$76.52|
|Current|12 Jan 2020|$70.62|

&#x200B;

XOP is currently sitting at 75.9% of its 52-Week high, and many other stocks in this sector are in similar standing. Why? Because oil has a lot of room for recovery as we move forward into a new administration and start coming out of quarantine. If an autist puts his money in now, he might achieve some solid gains over the next 12-18 months.

Are oil stocks going to the moon? Probably not, but you can always buy FDs and dream of hitting those sweet 2014 highs.

&#x200B;

Aside from [XOP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOP?p=XOP&.tsrc=fin-srch), there are a lot of other ETFs and stocks that you should research for yourself. Here's some examples, but there are tons out there.

Stocks:

* [Chevron](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVX?p=CVX&.tsrc=fin-srch)

Dow Jones:

""A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move,' short-selling expert from S3 says  


GameStop Corp. (GME) shares soared Wednesday in an apparent short squeeze, but one analyst who specializes in information on short selling doesn't think that's the case.  


GameStop shares surged more than 60% Wednesday -- which would be its largest one-day percentage gain ever, according to Dow Jones data --more than a week after short interest on the videogame retailer's stock exceeded the number of shares outstanding. At last check, more than 125 million shares had traded hands in the day's session, compared with a 52-week daily average volume of 6.5 million shares.  


**While GameStop has 69.8 million shares outstanding, short interest on the stock rose to 71.2 million shares on Dec. 31 from a previous 68.1 million shares, according to FactSet data.**  


On Monday, GameStop shares finished up 10% (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-stock-shoots-up-after-reaching-agreement-with-activist-investor-2021-01-11) after it reached an agreement with activist investor RC Ventures to add three of its members to the board, and advanced less than 0.1% on Tuesday. Also, on Monday, the company said holiday same-store sales rose 4.8% and that digital sales had jumped 309%.  


**While noting that shorts definitely were a part of the buying binge, Ihor Dusaniwsky -- the head of predictive analytics at financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners, which specializes in analyzing data on short selling -- said he doesn't agree that GameStop's price surge was the result of a squeeze.**  


""GME's board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,"" Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. ""While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question -- did long buying lead to short covering\\squeeze or short covering\\squeeze lead to long buying?""  


Dusaniwsky believes it's the former.  


**""We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,"" the analyst said. ""Long buyers are the primary force driving GME's stock price up. ""**  


GameStop shares have skyrocketed more than 500% in the past 12 months, compared with a 16% gain in the S&P 500 index and a 42% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index .

"Stock Market News for Today | GME Squeeze | BABA, INTC, TGT, AFRM & other Stock Market News [01-14]",question,91,0.99,kx52ui,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx52ui/stock_market_news_for_today_gme_squeeze_baba_intc/,46,"**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD & TSM suffer. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.

Despite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small & mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn’t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED’s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won’t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD & others, but I think this is more of a “hype move” right now. Intel has still fallen behind it’s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.

We also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled. 

We also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of ¾ of the US population.

Also, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.

While in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.

We also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu & Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China’s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the “big players” who get in at much lower prices.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.

VLS (Velocys) With waste to Million 🚀🚀🚀🚀,question,21,0.83,kx5szn,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kx5szn/vls_velocys_with_waste_to_million/,16,"Now that Gevo is growing so fast and has basically a similar goal to Velocys, I wanted to address Velocys once.                                          

Velocys is a company in England that, with government support, is building a factory that is expected to be ready by 2025.  

Currently market capital: 120MIO GBP

Velocys has some patents for the chemical conversion of waste to kerosene, which has already been successfully tested in aircraft. The advantage here: garbage is available in large quantities and costs nothing. In addition, Velocys is a partner of Shell and British Airways.

Velocys doesn't have to grow corn to produce fuel, so Velocys will launch the rocket to the moon.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Velocys is absolutely undervalued in compare with all other zero emission companys.

It’s the 13th largest holding in ARKQ. Due to the offering we should have a nice morning dip. If you look at the price movement it doesn’t look like weeklies will net you many tendies but further our dates are solid, especially if news drops between now and your exp date. I’ll be adding mostly commons but also grabbing  some May $10c’s

I recommend commons because 3D printing will be a massive part of our future. Market cap is 1.5B

1. Here is a company, about to pivot the fuckin foundation of how businesses strategize and make big buck decisions, and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Obvious cue ignored.
2. The real big bucks are flowing towards Palantir with long/short term million dollar contracts.. and ya'll bought BB out of the grave.
3. Citron punched PLTR first, then came Credit Sussie, then Morgan Stanley.... recently Citi... and ya'll had to show them your paper hands. PLTR is a diamond which needs the same. Big guys trying to downplay the stock till the next financials come in. Thats where they get in, and you keep watching the stock price go up. Obvious cue ignored.
4. Just like TSLA is backed by a CEO trying to change world conventions of commuting, energy and space travel. PLTR is the revolution of how corporations would strategize and optimize their existing pipelines! Still ya'll selling shares and buying puts. Obvious cue ignored.
5. Ya'll profited big time out of GME and BB. But, do you really even consider or plan to stay? Doesn't PLTR look like an obvious place to dump your gains?
6. Specifically for you ""simple men"" looking for 🚀- Alex Karp's entire life makes papa Musk's dance look normal.. and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Isn't Alex Karp's hair style enough for you to YOLO your life savings into PLTR?

Here is a company which is skyrocketing off of skyrocketting other companies and ya'll pumping GME and BB?

4. There is 25% upside just to get back to recent highs from Feb 2020.

They are one of the best bang for your buck companies in the sector. 3.5b in revenue and the market cap is only 3b with a p/e of 15. Market cap at 1 times revenue!!! Like seriously wtf is that.   

Biden is going to invest in environmental, social and governance sector which means there will be a huge payout for solar. Tax creds and tariff reductions baby. CSIQ already announced US largest PV and battery storage without a peep from the market. Methinks it’s cuz everyone on SPWR FSLR RUN and whatever other solar company with p/e 40+’s nuts. Fuck those guys  

And people be like “Canadian solar is actually backed by China and has no exposure to US”. To those people I say fucky fuckity fuck you duck. CSIQ is a global company with a subsidiary called Recurrent Energy which just sold a huge project in Cali.

Along with that, people been bankin on EV and that bubble bout to bust. However people still want a hand in clean energy or just green renewable companies in general. My guess is that these autists will rotate over to the solar sector which due for a massive pump like 2015-2016.   


The key here is that this shit is bout to 🚀 and all you cucks and autists that need some face after losing their dicks on GME weeklies today can make it up with

These two boys **made HSR filings + a request for early termination** (that was granted). For those of you who don't know what this means:

HSR filings are required (amongst a couple of other requirements) when someone is making an acquisition of >$94m (this is the rate for the past year in 2020. will likely hike somewhere to \~$100m in 2021). This is what we saw with Mithril when they bought a fuck ton of shares in December ([https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675))

**Early termination requests are made to bypass the customary 30-day waiting period when someone makes an HSR filing.** This implies that the individual wants to make a purchase in less than 30 days. Both of the early termination requests were granted. Karpy and Cohen are either buying leading up to demo day/the assumed (HOPEFULLY) price hike we see, or, maybe, right around lockup expy time.

I'd leave another thicc rocket for you fuckers, but mods keep auto-deleting the post because of the image.

**Source: Google, Reddit**

**None of this is originally written by myself and the purpose of this post is to consolidate information to portray perspective from both bears and bulls as neutral as possible for the benefit of new GME investors/speculators.**

**You are welcome to leave any valuable information or point out any misinformation in the comments and I'll add them to the post.**

**GameStop (GME)**

**Bear Thesis**

* Game console cycle in 2020
   * Boost in revenue due to new console cycle is temporary
   * Low margin on distributing game consoles
   * Main profit margin comes from software and virtual goods
* Brick & mortar is dying due to digitalization of gaming
   * Largest profit center for Gamestop is pre-owned and value video game
   * High revenue but low profit on new video game hardware and software sales
   * Gaming market is moving towards online game download instead of physical discs (Steam, Riot, Gaming Consoles)
   * It’s a matter of time game console manufacturers do not need them for distribution or service centers for their hardware
* Microsoft deal
   * A share of Microsoft Xbox’s digital revenue goes to Gamestop
   * Revenue share unannounced
   * What’s next after the multi-year deal end?
   * Revenue share does not include pre-owned console sales
* Continued closing of physical stores
   * Signifies accelerated closing of business
   * Directors taking profits after record week
   * Older board members sold part of their shares to profit after the record week
      * /u/Invisible0815 pointed out "" board members most likely sold because they will not stand for re-election in june. AND they didnt sell all their shares. one member had to sell because of his own funds regulations. i bet u, he didnt want to sell (hestia capital, he should be on cohens side cause he hates old management). ""

&#x200B;

* Bull case counterarguments from /u/baystreetdegenerate
   * Nintendo next game console in 2022
      * Okay, what happens in the downtime between console releases
      * **OP's reply**: Current generation of consoles are still being traded at GameStop, which is one of their revenue stream
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
      * Outside of tracking customer behavior on their website and sales and trade-in data what else can they even collect? Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much
      * **OP's reply:** Yes, I agree with you that developers and manufacturers have their own way of collecting data. However, GameStop will be able to provide data on the market overview of the gaming industry if they manage to pull of being a centralized e-commerce giant
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
      * That's what youtube is for...
      * **OP's reply:** I believe there's a market for people who prefer physical roadshows or showcases compared to online videos.
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
      * Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.
      * **OP's reply:** I do agree this idea seem far-fetched, but there is a possibility that it can be pulled off.
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
      * This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?
      * **OP's reply:** They may convert several stores into PC shops for the purpose of E-sports leagues/tournaments only but not operate a PC shop business. There's definitely money to be made in the growing e-sports scene. E.g. advertising, streaming, etc.
   * RYAN COHEN: e-commerce
      * How does his expertise in pet food ecommerce translate into brick and mortar gaming stores?
      * **OP's reply:** We are speculating that the management are going to announce their plans between Apr-Jun 2021.
   * Low price to sales ratio at 0.4476 as at 15/1/21
      * Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue

**Bear case conclusion**: Business turnaround fails and trend towards book value at a price target of $5.

&#x200B;

**Bull Thesis**

* Nintendo next game console in 2022
   * 4th year into Nintendo switch’s 7-year life cycle, estimated new console launch in 2022
   * Continue to be a distributor for game consoles and benefit from Nintendo’s new console launch
* Estimated total addressable market for gaming of USD151Bn and growing
   * Established relationship with 42 million gamers through PowerUp Rewards loyalty program
   * 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop in 2019
   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming
   * Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers
* Vendor partnerships
   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts
   * Opportunity to monetize publisher and console manufacturer relationships
   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions
   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores
* Brand recognition of GameStop and a lack of centralization for gaming
   * Opportunity for GameStop to be a centralized e-commerce platform for gaming consoles, digital games, merchandise, customization of computers, laptops, gaming chairs, etc.
* Low price to sales ratio at **0.4476** as at 15/1/21
* Board refreshment - Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal and Jim Grube previously from successful Chewy Inc. (CHWY)
   * Proven successful e-commerce track record
   * Acceleration of digital transformation with new board members
* **RYAN COHEN**
   * Founder of Chewy
   * **Largest e-commerce acquisition.** Sold Chewy to PetSmart in April 2017 for **USD 3.35 billion**
   * Chewy went public in 2019 at a valuation of **USD 8.7 billion.**
   * Saw an opportunity in GameStop and took a stake of **12.9% as of latest SEC filing**
* Potential short squeeze (Speculative)
   * Estimated short interest of 138% not covered
   * Any positive news or materialization of bull case may send share price further up
   * Eventually shorts may have to cover and send the share price even higher
* /u/OCOWAx pointed out that /u/ethandavid did a DD on GME converting stores into PC kiosks, link below
   *  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming) 

**Bull case conclusion:** Successful business turnaround and prove going concern. Being an e-commerce leader in the gaming industry.

I study finance and economics and today I've been reading about macro indexes for comapnies. It's nothing new I just thought someone may learn new from this and I also consolidate my knowledge doing that.

We see massive amount of  headlines saying ""the burst is behind the corner!1one1"" on daily basis. If you take a look at most popular economy measures, everything is alright. Let's analyze it together:

1. GDP - US GPD per capita is still raising. There was a dip in 2008 and Q1 2020 for obvious reasons. Now we see rising trend and analysts estimate it to keep raise at least for the next few years. The simple rule says that if the GPD drops for 2 quarters or more the recession is coming. 🚀🚀🚀

2. Unemployment - it went up drastically last March but it has improved by 8% already. The trend is more important in unemployment, than the numbers itself the chart flattened in Dec but it still doesn't indicate recession in any means. 🚀🚀

It took a lot of research and typing to prepare this for you. But personally I'm a GME believer and it WILL fly 🚀. 

So you bought GME shares because strangers online told you to and you begin to ask yourself if you are retarded. The answer is yes, yes you are. But there is a good chance you are a lucky retard. If you are FOMO guy you have to decide which scenario is more likely and enter if you believe in happy endings. 
  
There is a lot of noise regarding GME and there is barely any good DD anymore. This is why I decided to put this together. You have to keep in mind that I am a retard myself and not an OG GME gang. I entered GME in January at $19, paper handed in worst possible moment at $32 because I thought squeeze has sqoze. I am now back in the game and reinvested my profit and more back into GME. Only reason why I feel competent to do this is because a) I read a lot about GME and shovel through all the noise to find meaningful info b) apparently no one else is willing to do it properly.  
    
So here it goes from the worst case to the best. All possible scenarios I can think of. If I miss anything or I messed something up, please let me know and I will update this list. This is not a financial advice. You have to make up your own mind and if you can actually read, do your own research.   
  
##**""WE ARE FUCKED!"" scenarios:**  
  
***Ryan Cohen played us all (EDIT: it appears this scenario is impossible. Leaving this up as another proof that I am indeed retarded.)***  
In this scenario RC sells or already sold his shares. We have been duped and it all has been pump and dump. We are all royally fucked.  

For this scenario:   
  
* RC, despite what you can read around here, is not your actual daddy. He is a business man looking to make profit.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* RC is fucking rich and if he wanted, he could already retire. 
* It would ruin his credibility.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that RC sold his shares, price reaches near 0 within minutes. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Near zero chance this happens. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is very low.  
   

***GME is practically bankrupt***  
It turns out that RC comes in too late. GME is bankrupt in few months.  

For this scenario:   
  
* That was shorters play from the beginning.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* According to DD posted by people on WSB, GME books look good.  
* New console cycle, stimulus money, post COVID optimism all point that GME should be afloat longer then we need them to.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that GME is in a very bad condition. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Very low chance that this happens due to againsts. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is 0.  
   
***Shorters pull a fast one on us***  
In this scenario institutions find a way to squeeze margin positions, outplay options and wait out long positions.  
  
For this scenario:   
  
* They have written the rules of the game and honestly, they know much better how to play it then us. 
  
Against this scenario:  
  
* If they could do it they would probably have already done it instead of loosing almost a billion in options last Friday.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Serious price drop on Tuesday despite short restrictions.   
* Price falls in following days below $20 per share and refuses to come back up for a very long time.  

  
My personal opinion:  
  
* Non-zero chance this happens. It is possible. But IMO unlikely because I believe that if they could save their options they would have done it already. PT: uncertain but definitely below $20. $10-$15 if I had to guess.   
   
##**Neutral scenarios:**   
  
***We are in a deadlock aka. ""neutral but actually bad""***  
In this case old shorts are actually covered and we have new shorts on our hands. Price volatility and actual price slowly decrease. Both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months.    
 
For this scenario:  
  
* Institutions has already proven that they are committed to their shorts. And they will not admit defeat.
* Shorts have more money and patience.
* If shorts are replaced by new ones, they will not bleed (but that's unlikely).  
* We believe, but a lot of us have paper hands and/or can't afford to keep cash frozen to wait this out.  
* Hype will die down and with it our conviction.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money.  
* If the price remains low ($30 or below), there *may* come other large investors for a long position after they realize that this is a good value investment. This would trigger good scenarios.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. 
  
My personal opinion:  

* Honestly I'm mostly afraid of this scenario. But at the same time it's not very likely that shorts are replaced. Then again, if nothing major happens relativly soon, this is still a likely scenario. PT: $25-$30 for months to come until one side wins.
   
***We are in a deadlock aka. ""neutral but actually good""***  
In this case price volatility slowly decreases, and both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months. But in this scenario we overcome our collective retardation and show how strong we are through our unity. Price slowly rises over next months as shorts slowly close their positions.   
 
For this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money and will be covering their shorts.  
* One should never underestimate autists.   
  
Against this scenario:  

* United retards with diamond hands? Retail investors are market makers? I want to believe that we have that power but lets keep it real.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. But the trend will become upward after that.
  
My personal opinion:  

* Hard to say. I think some actually good scenarios are more likely then this one.  
   
 
##**Good scenario:**  
  
***Slow and steady short squeeze***  
We win! Shorts are out of ammo, Friday dip was their last hail Mary to stop loses on their puts and are forced to close their position. GME begins it's burn to the moon!
  
For this scenario:  

* Shorts are already kind of fucked.  
* Big investment firms have proven many times before that they are arrogant and they can be very wrong.  
* GME is shorted into oblivion and unless it declares bankruptcy in next weeks or months they will HAVE to exit.  
* Any good news will make this only more likely (like new investor reveals that they are getting involved for a long position).  
  
Against this scenario:  

* Like I said before, we don't exactly know what shorts could have up their sleeve.  
* If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not be forced.   
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price jumps on Tuesday and continues the trend more slowly later even without short restrictions.  
  
My personal opinion:  

* It's likely and this is my bet. PT: very hard to say but could be anywhere between $60 and $200 or even way more in next weeks or months.   
   
##**Mother of all Short Squeezes**  
   
***We make history***  
It turnes out RC actually is your father. In next few days or weeks he reveals his master plan and shorts are royally fucked. They will sing songs about us.  
   
For this scenario:  

* All of the ""good scenarios"" fors, but the good news is actually something big RC or GME reveals that sends shorts running for their life. 
  
Against this scenario:  

*  RC signed a document that prohibits him from acquiring more then 20% shares and while float is low compared to shorts, it's not enough for MOASS.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price opens at $200 or $400 and only goes up. Sorry FOMO guys, the rocket missed the Moon is already past Jupiter.  
   
My personal opinion:  
  
* I and many others dream that RC drops a bomb before Tuesday, but I honestly give this maybe 10% chance of happening. PT: a random number between $420.69 and infinity.   
   
##**Dear FOMO guys**  
If you decide that GME hype is not empty and that the Moon is within reach, please buy non leveraged shares. Margin, leverage or options could fuck you up short term even if in the end we win. 
    
##My position:  
254 long shares at $35.90, 205 leveraged shares at $36.48 (most protected down to $23, considering protecting them even more). Don't judge me, I am europoor.",2021-01-17 20:58:43,

If you look at the short squeeze of VW in 2008 you'll see the massive spike... and then a slightly higher trading price than before. If you think you'll get off at the peak, you're wrong. Some will, but most won't. 

You'll probably be too busy massaging your wife's bull or driving to the store to pick up more of his condoms to notice that the spike happened. It lasted for a day. 

You will watch the price go up and up, think about all the lambos you will buy, and when you check robinhood again... you missed it. The price never reached 420.69. Maybe it hit 420.54. Or 419.73. And you fucking missed it. 

Maybe your strategy is to take a week off of work and keep your eyes on the stock. Maybe you have a trailing stop set. Maybe you're just along for the ride and plan on taking gains after the spike. Whichever it is, make sure you know when you'll get off.",2021-01-17 22:12:45,

“In this retail-driven market this defense is not working. Almost all of our “sold to retail” stocks are going up simultaneously because the market is driven by the least sophisticated gamblers we have seen in markets in our professional lifetimes. So rather than shrinking one-or-two stocks (as per normal risk management practice for us) we have been forced to cut large numbers of shares across many sectors.
This means that collectively we have spent over USD100 million buying back stock we think is worthless. We are appalled” 

“You, dear clients, however have a choice to make – and we will understand if you make it. Our recent results are not good; but we believe our future will be better, for this period too will end. However, perhaps you possibly know a young manager who has earned well over 100 percent this year. You might want to take your money there. It pains us to say this – but given our results we will understand if you do”

im also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates. Im not fucking liable lmao but i am balls deep 125 shares @ 19 average now, its literally all I have on this earth.

TLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin wont affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **🐻 🌈s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**

Compulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Basically been seeing posts about ""blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah"". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something

# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.

So basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

THEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having ""Digital game exchanging"" or something, image below.

[Online trade ins. It says online.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/2ba9j5d2zvb61.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6f3f26c3588fdb8cc779aee8a3b1ce42859f33)

He also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\_dd\_buildapc\_kiosks\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)

BUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?

**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**

The expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.

In the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.

We are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.

Burry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.

GME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying ""omnichannel"" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.

Now I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.

Holdiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:

>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.

Maniacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.

So in the heading i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.

[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \(another reason shorts are fuk\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)

>The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)

This alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:

9.8/2.48 = \~3.95   3.95 \* $35.5 = \~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better.

from [statista](https://statista.com) :

>Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.

If we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \* 1.0224\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!

I really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout ""DigITaL"" or ""BlOCKbuSTER"" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those guys special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10.

**Bears are betting against:**

Ryan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion

Michael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april

u/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale

Reggie Fils-Aimé, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo

Senvest, a mega fund thats actively managed

Norweigan sovereign wealth fund

Fidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit

All of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears

Microsoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.

&#x200B;

Some valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.

# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.

Ok everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.

Although I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.

This squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.

**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**

*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.

*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**

Short shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**

Short shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million

% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020

% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.

Some [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.

The recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.

Gamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.

[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)

Need rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:

Ok so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts ""blockbuster"" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?

Ortex data from Jan 4th 2021:

[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)

So this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \~21 to \~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.

These shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.

SHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.

Cost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.

Longs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to 💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).

**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**

You realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.

**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**

**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**

&#x200B;

[This shows the suspected melvin puts \(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)

[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)

These two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.

Something else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

We are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.

Regardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.

**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**

Bear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.

Kodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**

Volkswagen went from **\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**

Overstock went from **\~$21 to $123**

Blue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**

Ive been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.

$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \* 1.0281\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .

This shit can happen. Hold on.

**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**

&#x200B;

[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)

Basically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.

This happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.

Now we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.

**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**

IHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD

Ihor I quote:

>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**

Ihor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down ""Short squeeze has happend"" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.

The bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.

Edit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox. See you at andromeda! Also more rockets.**

Edit\*\*: Some autists thought lottery ticket was misleading so instead, gauranteed lottery numbers!\*\*

Edit 4: [Amazing post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzbzhe/gme_warning_bears_are_among_us_tuesday_is_bullish/) showing that unlucky prize guy was wrong like I said. Ihor also talked about the hypothecation  agreement.

>There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).

Edit 6: We are scraping 42 in frankfurt. Granted its low volumes but pre market should open at these prices I think?

**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, 🐻 🌈  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**",2021-01-17 23:06:07,

The Full DD on $BB: An Elon Musk+Jeff Bezos sandwich for our Supreme Leader John Chen,dd,3200,0.98,l0a1p5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a1p5/the_full_dd_on_bb_an_elon_muskjeff_bezos_sandwich/,563,"So you bought $BB at $11 pre-market friday. Smart move my fellow degens 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.

TL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.

Before you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.

You've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.

So why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*

**Zombie cars and QNX**

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX. [Baidu?](https://www.chinapev.com/baidu/baidu-and-blackberry-unite-to-integrate-qnx-system-in-apollo-platform/) QNX baby. [XPENG?](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-08-26/washed-up-phone-maker-blackberry-provides-autonomous-vehicle-safety-system-to-xpeng-101597348.html) Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Linux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.

That's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in ""Fate of the Furious"" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.

You know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.

The best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.

Now that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Blackberry x AWS IVY**

IVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑

So what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.

IVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.

But you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.

Best part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.

For me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",2021-01-19 10:28:44,

GME Leadership wants the squeeze to happen. How we may be able to tell the top.,dd,1218,0.98,l0a3zk,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0a3zk/gme_leadership_wants_the_squeeze_to_happen_how_we/,352,"Ryan Cohen is abundantly aware of the short squeeze potential. He had 2k twitter followers just a week ago. Who do you think he's tweeting to with emojis and gifs? Us. 

He can't come out and bluntly discuss all of this. The SEC would be on his ass. His lawyers have already made him delete a tweet that was just a picture about a roller coaster.

Imagine that shit. And now he tweets a 🥜 and retard at us. He is excited and literally can't contain it.

But that ain't what I'm here to talk about today.

The squeeze is going to happen. It is in GameStop's best interest for this squeeze to happen.

Y'all keep asking what is the optimal price target to exit. **No one fucking knows**. 

This is gonna go past $100. After that, I have no idea where it goes and no one else does either.

Remember [this shelf offering](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520312805/d67321d424b5.htm) we learned about at the last earnings call?

The immediate reaction was bearish. The stock dipped. Our retardation was in question. Paper hands jumped ship because management was clearly too stupid to realize a squeeze was on the horizon.

Turns out, management ain't as stupid as you think they are.

**The optimal play for GameStop is to let us squeeze to the moon and then deploy the shelf offering at the top.**

It'll maximize tendies for all parties involved.

What does this mean for us?

The squeeze is coming because **EVERYONE BUT MELVIN** wants it to happen.

Imagine the news coverage GME would get from a historic short squeeze as it moves forward into a new Cohen World Order. GME wants this and prepared for this with their shelf offering.

**My advice:** I don't know if it will be possible, but keep track of all GME news and if news comes out that the shelf offering is being deployed, then I recommend selling. As that may signal the top.

**TL;DR:** Ryan Cohen and GME leadership know about the squeeze. This will trigger. They will deploy their shelf offering at the top. If you hear about it, sell to maximize tendies.

**Positions:** 3300 shares at $16. Loads of 35c 4/16 options.

Amicus Therapeutics ($FOLD) heading for Cosmos 🚀 🚀 🚀,dd,25,0.84,l18fb3,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18fb3/amicus_therapeutics_fold_heading_for_cosmos/,22,"**Amicus Therapeutics** is a global biotech company focused on discovering, developing and delivering new innovative medicine for rare diseases.

Their CEO is **John Crowley**, a Harvard MBA & Naval Academy grad with a mission to help kids around the world. You know he has the right work ethic and more importantly, the right motivation to see this through, because his own kid suffers from one of the rare diseases he is looking to treat in the near future (*Pompe* disease).

Their current revenue-generating star is a drug called **Galafold**, a pill meant to treat a rare disease called *Fabry* disease. This disease affects approximately 1 in 40000 men worldwide and Galafold is currently the best and most convenient method of treatment.

[2020 Revenue](https://apnews.com/press-release/globe-newswire/business-technology-science-pandemics-public-health-560528f65fcb19c3c0d7b261224e1f3e#:~:text=Global%20revenue%20for%20Galafold%20in,the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20towards) for Galafold was $261 million, and the company has previously stated they are on track to hit the[$500 million](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3015206&headline=FOLD-Amicus-says-Galafold-on-track-for-M-revenue-by-) yearly revenue mark by 2023 for this drug alone.

Now, where the real potential for cosmic launch magical shenanigans lies is in their [upcoming treatments](https://www.amicusrx.com/programs-pipeline/pipeline/) for *Batten* disease and *Pompe* disease. Do yourself a favor and read through, because this is a potentially undiscovered gem that is about to rock the world of rare diseases and quite literally do God's work in helping kids around the world.

# Pompe disease

Amicus is currently on track to publish results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of their Pompe disease treatment within the next weeks, as their study [concludes this month.](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03729362?term=NCT03729362&draw=2&rank=1)

This drug trial [has previously been fast tracked by the FDA](https://ir.amicusrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/us-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-btd-amicus-gaa) and the drug([AT-GAA](https://pompediseasenews.com/atb200-at2221/)) has been given the BTD (*Breakthrough Therapy Designation*) by the agency, which is one of the most promising votes of confidence from the country's leading healthy agency.

Currently, estimates show there are up to 12,000 patients suffering from Pompe disease worldwide, and the current treatment cost for Pompe is $300000 (yes you read that right), with a drug offered by another bio company called BioMarin.

If approved, Amicus' AT-GAA drug will be the most efficient treatment method for Pompe in the US (and potentially worldwide).

Now, I have no idea of how they might be pricing this novel drug, however even if they undercut their competitors by 50% (which is really unheard of), that puts the cost for the treatment at $150000, meaning an **initial potential revenue of $1.8 billion** worldwide (not counting the newly added cases of Pompe in the population, yearly).

The company has recently initiated a [rolling FDA submission](https://pompediseasenews.com/2020/12/02/amicus-begins-rolling-fda-submission-of-late-onset-pompe-disease-lopd-therapy-at-gaa/) seeking US approval for their drug, meaning that they will start submitting important parts of their application as they go, rather than submitting the entire application at once. What this means for you, my dear autist is that good news will start trickling in as early as next month, gently rolling upwards into a phallic crescendo of green colors aimed for interstellar space by the end of this year.

# Batten disease

Amicus is in their [Phase 2 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02725580) for this treatment, scheduled for completion in November this year.

What's important to know here is that the incidence rate for this disease varies around the world, and from my research, I can estimate it on the **lower** end of that variation to 1 in 100000 people.

Their treatment for Batten disease is a **gene therapy** treatment, and what's even MORE important to know here is that[a similar gene therapy treatment is known to cost more than $2 million](https://battendiseasenews.com/2019/12/10/gene-therapy-takes-center-stage-at-2019-nord-summit/). Yes, you also read that fucking right.

With about 1300 people being born with this disease **every year**, that means a **potential revenue of $2.6 billion**. Now, of course not everyone in every country will afford this (depending on their medical insurance/coverage), but still that's an insane amount of money.

And the paramount factor here is that this is a fucking terrible disease, with devastating effects on the sick patients and on their families. We're all lucky to have these people working on fixing it. There are about 6000 rare diseases affecting people around the world, and Amicus is destined to be a spearhead company tackling problems which have not been tackled before.

The company [is working with University of Pennsylvania](https://ir.amicusrx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amicus-therapeutics-and-university-pennsylvania-announce-major) on discovering additional gene therapy treatments for other diseases.

# Key Takeaways

* Galafold drug set to generate $500 mil revenue by 2023.
* AT-GAA Drug (Pompe disease) set to hit the market by 2023, with a potential yearly revenue of $1.8 billion.
* CLN6 gene therapy treatment (Batten disease) set to hit the market by 2025, with a potential yearly revenue of $2.6 billion.
* AT-GAA Phase 3 Trial results to come in the next few weeks, with rolling application to receive partial submissions throughout 2021.
* CLN6 gene therapy Phase 2 trial concludes in November 2021, with results to come in December 2021/January 2022.
* Recent whale has placed a $1.7 million bet that $FOLD will trade above $36.50 by March and another $2.7 million bet that $FOLD will trade above $31 by March. (info courtesy of [u/socmonkey](https://www.reddit.com/u/socmonkey/))
* You can bet your sweet ass that captain John will see this through, as he's made his mission to save the sick children of the world.

Now, if all this does not give you a raging green hard on then I don't know what does. I understand we're all at war with the Melvins and what not, but do yourself a favor and do not ignore other potential runners that have the possibility of blessing your kingdoms with tendie rains for the years to come. Biotech and big pharma companies are known to explode to obscene valuations after pushing new treatments.

Andrew Left - An Introduction to Fraud. 🍋,question,281,0.98,l18ffi,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18ffi/andrew_left_an_introduction_to_fraud/,31,"Let’s start with his false and misleading reports that banned him from the Hong Kong markets for 5 years. 

https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years

Next he tried to sue Tesla

“This appears to be a textbook case of fraud,” Labaton Sucharow partner Michael Canty said in the release. “We believe Musk attempted to manipulate the price of Tesla securities with false and misleading tweets, in a directed effort to harm short-sellers.”

From the man who tweets misleading reports as per Hong Kong and tweets in a directed effort to benefit himself. 🐍 

Let’s continue. His cute disclaimer on his website. 

https://citronresearch.com/legal-disclaimer/

He makes no representations and disclaims all accuracy and timeliness of material. (I can make shit up). It’s for “informational purposes only” (yh sure).

“Under no circumstances should our reports be considered investment advice” yet they tweet “buyers at these levels are suckers”. Not investment advice but don’t invest ... 

“You agree to hold harmless citron research for anything attributable to our report.” Do i? Just because it’s written doesn’t mean I agree to that, no.

“Citron research has positions in securities covered in reports ... and may continue to transact for an indefinite period after a report” ie. we can sell our own dip. That’s fine. Trust me, I wrote it in my disclaimer. 

“All expressions of opinion are subject to change without notice” same shit, we can buy them sell while we mislead you all our original idea and actually buy a dip. Lol get fucked followers. 

Finally, “at no point will citron be liable for any claims, damages of any kind” etc. “Arising or out of in any way connected with any information presented in our reports” ie. we can lie, make shit up and we are invincible because we wrote it here. This applies “regardless of any negligence or gross negligence of citron research” so even if we are grossly negligent, still not our fault. 

Etc. Etc. Bullshit bullshit. Fraud fraud. 

What’s ironic is he does have a history of reporting some companies and uncovering fraud therefore reporting them to the SEC. Naturally, over a few years I imagine this is why the SEC turns a blind eye. They have a bastard making money for himself in many cases illegally, but twice a year he does find a fraudulent company and the SEC can say thank you very much for doing their job for them. 

Oh, and the NFA did him over for making “false and misleading statements to cheat, defraud and deceive a customer in violation of FNA compliance” back in 1998 banning him for 3 years. His ethics training course was really helpful, clearly. 

Oh and this - which basically makes out that he’s some bad ass, and openly discusses how he opens his position, tweets bad news, moves the markets, a stock falls 15%, promises to go on tv, panics the market and explicitly talks about his influence through Twitter. Not a bounty hunter, he’s a white collar criminal. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/magazine/the-bounty-hunter-of-wall-street.html

TLDR. Andrew left is a fraud who mixes finding genuinely fraudulent companies and exposing them, with random hit pieces of self interest and stock manipulation. The SEC have been helped by several of his discoveries so they don’t give a shit that he’s immoral and corrupt. We can’t even stop him making money as he sells/buys on the dips his own report creates.

Edit 2. Shock. The fucker delays. Of course he does. Needs more time to close out his positions, spread fear amongst us for another 24 hours. Christ. This is so fucking illegal. But it’s fine, claim he “forgot” I guess.",2021-01-20 20:42:19,

AMD: Undervalued at $90,dd,119,0.92,l18iz9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18iz9/amd_undervalued_at_90/,48,"\[I couldn't post yesterday: had to remove a link\]

AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I’ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well. 

**Intel struggles**

Last week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)

**AMD Q4 and FY**

EPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.

**2021&2022 Outlook**

But the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC’s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU’s that can go head to head with NVDA’s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply a P/E off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML’s for example (60). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.

**Booming Market**

Finally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion. Also, ASML had earnings today and raised their outlook as well. This could imply that supply is not as constrained as some people are assuming for the coming year(s). This has led to me being more bullish than before.

2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan’21 100Calls.

Cost to borrow has also declined slightly to 22.9%. I was hoping the shorts to double down(Shitron related) which would result in the cost of borrowing to go up. 

As COB could increase exponentially, it would have been painful for the shorts; even though my hope seems not to be materializing, but whatever, it's still very high. Old shorts seems to be playing it safe.

138% sHoRT fLoAt! Why it's wrong (and right) to compare GameStop to Volkswagen,question,381,0.9,l1s627,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1s627/138_short_float_why_its_wrong_and_right_to/,179,"Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  🚀 🚀 🚀

I've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.

First, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from €348 to over €1K in the single day that it squeezed.

As for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).

Institutional Certified Diamond Handers

|**Fund**|**Shares Held**|**% O/S**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC|9,534,090|13.67|
|RC Ventures LLC|9,001,000|12.91|
|BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.|7,897,907|11.32|
|Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund|6,801,757|9.75|
|The Vanguard Group, Inc.|5,288,116|7.58|
|iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF|3,514,708|5.04|
|Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund|2,000,679|2.87|
|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|1,468,071|2.1|
|iShares Russell 2000 ETF|1,368,843|1.96|
|DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio|1,121,503|1.61|
|Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund|817,863|1.17|
|Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund|703,551|1.01|
|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|634,259|0.91|
|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|
|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|
|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|

Outstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!

Again, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \~$120 from this scenario.

Didn’t even move an inch at this news. Stocks only go up! 🚀🚀🚀

Well buckle up because we’re about to see the economy absolutely explode. Here’s why. 

While there are still an average of 3000+ people dying from covid everyday there are some interesting statistics behind the deaths that we should look at. 

Over 80% of covid deaths are in the 65+ age range. 

There are 56 million Americans in that age range (65+) 

Currently the US has given out 17.2 million doses and in the last 7 days we’ve averaged 900,000 per day. (This number was 800,000 yesterday) so we’re probably doing well over 1 mil doses per day. 


Let’s assume in the next month we’ll be able to average 1.5m doses.



That’s 1.5m x 30 = 45m 

45m + 17m (already administered) = 62m 

If 30% of those 62m goes to “frontline essential” workers and the other 70% goes to old people. We should see 43m vaccines going to the high risk population within a month. 

43/56 = 75% of the older population vaccinated 

0.75 * 0.95 ( effective rate of vaccine) = 73% 

0.73 * 0.8 ( percentage of deaths attributed to this age group) = 58% in reduced deaths in one month! 

Basically covid will be gone within a month and a half MAX.

SOME of what he said was technically accurate...but those things can be countered with little effort.

1. There is no short squeeze and shares are cheap to borrow!

Really?  Then why is there still negative float?  Why the bombardment of negative media coverage, including your tweet timed just as momentum was trending towards the $50 mark Tuesday? Why the flood of brand new user accounts on financial social media sites relentlessly bashing the stock? And a borrow rate of 30%? Doesn't seem very fucking cheap to me.

2. Numbers don't lie, people lie.

Yes fuck taco, you've lied many times to create a panic scenario in order to make money off of put options...thank you for pointing that out.  I'm sure the SEC will be bending you over eventually this year....AGAIN.

Sales being down for console launch was a result of two primary things: bot purchases sucking inventory availability, and the fact that 75% of the malls across the country were at required limited capacities with less average traffic than 20 fucking years ago due to covid.  Hard to sell things out of a store that can't be open.

3. Valuation matters.  

Yes it does.  All future projected earnings were based off of the EXISTING antiquated business model.  It is fairly clear at this point after Cohen's letter to the board in November that the company will no longer be following this business model AT ALL. While we don't have the particulars of the plan yet, we do know that Cohen, his COO, CFO, CMO built an e-commerce from scratch with a little over 100 million funding and turned it in to a business  that within four years had a 20x revenue multiple and made Jeff fucking Bezos back down from competing aggressively against it.

4. Know who's on the other side of the trade.

Here he implies that all the people buying the stock are dipshits that deliver his fat ass Pizza, while the douchebags running Melvin Capital are the smartest guys around.  What he fails to acknowledge is that individually we might be dumb as rocks, collectively we have unending resources for due diligence, and by now have clearly laid out the underlying true value potential far better then the hedgies who's due diligence has amounted to ""short into oblivion cuz it's Blockbuster 2.0, end of story."" not acknowledging the fact that there's greater odds they've just been complacent thinking that no one would notice they over leveraged themselves on what they just assumed was a sure bet.  He also implies that Ryan Cohen would just take the money and run as if this was a fucking swing trade for him.  It's not only an insult to his intent and vision, but it's an insult to our faith in his character.

5. Your company can become your biggest enemy ie. an offering to raise cash and dilute stock value.

You think we give a fuck if they throw out an at the market shelf offer when this hits $300 after we bankrupt fuckers like you?  The diamond hands in this legion are not going to get salty if they lose a quarter or half of their profits after being up 500%.  It is something that they should actually do...but if they've paid attention at all to what's going on (how could they not?) they know that we're on the precipice of a uncontrollable skyrocket of share price that they can take advantage of.  You think they're going to settle for $40? Think again dipshit.  SIDE NOTE: please don't buy at 300 okay retards?

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market-driving news (Jan 21, 2021 GME euphoria edition)",news,99,0.98,l2a0e9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/,20,"* The market was a bit mixed today compare to yesterday's nonstop buying - but tech continued its skyrocket after yesterday's bullish inauguration run. AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.

* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.

* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. 

* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.

* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -3% to around $60. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%. As with before, AMD's AH is a reverse of INTC with Su Bae showing boomer INTC what's up. AMD is up another 2.8% AH to $94.10.

* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.

* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.

* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.

* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.

* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

Thursday EOD GME Gamma and OI Update,dd,110,0.9,l2a27c,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a27c/thursday_eod_gme_gamma_and_oi_update/,108,"**TLDR: GME gamma remains elevated. Estimates: $10 price increase forces about 12m shares bought by dealers; $10 price decrease forces 23m shares sold by dealers. Not necessarily bullish or bearish. Expect vol around 39/40 price range. Slight expirations tomorrow that will pressure the stock down about 1-2%, so buying or selling pressure can send it up or down, it's just 'naturally' going down 1-2% with no net buy or sell.**

I'm attempting to provide this with no bullish or bearish read. As last week, I'm bearish and have a slight put position, which has been a real loser this week, go bulls, and most of all go thetagang.

But this analysis is intended to be neutral, and I leave it to you to interpret, and there are legitimate bullish or bearish reads out of the raw data here.

Like prior posts, GME has so many options on it that the behaviors of option dealers/ market makers are significant if price moves by creating clusters of short gamma on their books.

This assumes that dealers are pretty short options (meaning, they sold them to you guys).

When there are a lot of short options at a strike, much like a bunch of matter in one place creates a gravity well that makes things move faster through it, a concentration of you degenerates has similar impact on stock price movements. The quanta of those field interactions is the Degeneron, which will hopefully be on investopedia soon. If you get too much in one place, it creates a singularity (degenerity) in which price and volume are swapped, red becomes green and green becomes red, and a new wormhole is created into a new universe in which celery sticks replace tendies, and r/investing advocates YOLO investing because it's suddenly wholesome and responsible.

Explained more directly, huge gamma concentrations create a price movement acceleration because dealers have to sell stock when price falls, and buy stock as price rises, to be fully hedged on their short options and not lose money. And they almost never lose money.

Here's the current state of things:

[https://imgur.com/a/VX5b0mv](https://imgur.com/a/VX5b0mv)

Right now, if we were to go up $10 from here, dealers would also have to buy about 12 million GME shares, assuming about 80% of all options are net short on the dealer, which should be about right with how much speculation is going on.

Using similar assumptions, if we were to go down  $10 from here, dealers would need to sell about 23 million shares. If you want to equalize on % terms, I guess trim that down to 18 or 19, but those are equal money amounts naively.

This is kind of asymmetric and oversells the down ramp though because most of the gamma ramp is very near at 39/40, which means you can expect a rapid price movement down if it gets near 41 with momentum, but would slow down somewhat after passing 38.5 or so.

This is because gamma ramp remains largest at 39/40. It is also significant at 45. There's a more equally distributed ramp in the territory under 40. But most of the ramp is that 40/39 that we passed over today, and that drove a lot of the price action today.

There are gammas at 60 and 30, and they are significant (would describe as medium), but they are far away.

Remember, gamma only matters if the buying or selling gets you near the price range. And gamma ramps only matter if large. On virtually all stocks, it is not large. It is large on GME, and sometimes other WSB stocks, particularly smaller cap ones.

In terms of open interest expiring this week (also in that link), it's a lot less than last week, about 3.1m shares of exposure of in the money calls. Compared to last weeks 10% down movement, you'd expect only a few % of pressure from this tomorrow, and that starts to fade if price goes down, so I would SWAG it at 1-2% of downwards pressure from option rolls/sells that are obligatory on friday.

**Edit Friday 11:45 est - looks like dealers did buy those shares 12m shares and we are past the gamma ramp. Given 35m volume they account for the vast majority of net buying.This means further buying is a far heavier lift, about 2x the buying force already applied today to get to 55. Would be surprised to see a lot of movement up from here though as always depends on how much new capital is attracted by the momentum. It also means you can expect downwards price pressure through end of day today as weeklies in the money get offloaded and rolled or monetized. This now means upwards ramp is minimal in the order of about 1-2m million shares to 56 then another few million at 60 and nothing beyond, and downwards gamma ramp remains all the way down to 20, though heaviest at 38/40**",2021-01-22 06:59:07,

As is tradition, **we are talking about a $2.5 billion market cap company that has $1.7+ billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $1.1+ billion and growing at ridiculous levels! 🚀**

We are back to focusing on some DD featured by you retards throughout my comments and messages.

Also, some amazing work was mentioned by a veteran u/hearttatertots:

>Callaway also partners with Birdies for the Brave. A non-profit program for disabled veterans who have an interest in golf. They bring them to a PGA event and due a professional club fitting for free (get the free clubs 8 weeks later) and lets them meet all the pros.

AMD Gang Since 2013,question,47,0.98,l2pqrf,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2pqrf/amd_gang_since_2013/,23,"This post contains no numbers and no news. This I is about my experience with AMD and what I think the future holds for them based on what I see in the industry. 

In 2013 I bought a gaming PC from my neighbor at a garage sale. The PC had an AMD FX 8350 in it. I spent around $1k on the PC upgrading everything. To this day, the PC still has that same AMD FX processor. Before everyone jumped on the Ryzen hype, I was there, believing. When I got the PC I told my dad to buy $100 worth of AMD stock for me. They were worth a dollar something at the time. They are now worth around $100 a share. Sadly, I didn’t make the Tendies from then investment when I was a kid who saw potential in AMD. 

On July 6th of this 2020, I bought in myself because i knew how great the company was from year of experience. I have been holding ever since and will continue to hold and buy in. AMD, in my mind, is undervalued. Not because of technical analysis or earnings. But because of what I see in the real world. Friends of mine who bought and built PC’s back when I did, had Intel CPU’s in their PC’s. Some of them have never even heard of AMD processors. Between then and now. All of my friends who have upgraded their PC’s have switched to AMD. Everyone who knows a thing or two about PC’s at least considers going AMD instead of Intel. 

You might be thinking it’s too late to buy now, too late to invest in AMD. Your loss. AMD is starting to do the same thing with Graphics Cards, laptops and Server parts that they did with gaming CPU’s. I foresee them having the same takeover they had with gaming CPU’s in the laptop, GPU, and server chip space. The potential is huge. Big cloud  companies like Amazon, Google etc. are starting to switch their servers from Intel Xeon to AMD Epyc. This can make AMD much more money than gaming processors. I don’t know much about Xilinx but i believe if AMD follows the same philosophy they do with their other chips, they can bring Xilinx to the top. AMD had a lot further to go. 🚀🚀

Update on GME VSA,chart,1187,0.98,l2psn8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2psn8/update_on_gme_vsa/,95,"I made a post yesterday about watching interest at highs.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to update this mornings trading so far made new highs (during NYSE on-hours) on low volume relative to previous volumes.

&#x200B;

I can't see off market volume in relation to open hours charts. Take that into consideration.

&#x200B;

TLDR = Relatively low interest at highs = no ceiling yet for rockets

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xxbwojq1iwc61.png?width=3512&format=png&auto=webp&s=6529d1c29532656a50eaca5cb277fd3aba7b5b70

Please tell me if this is annoying or if this is interesting. I'm doing it for myself anyway and will stop posting if no interest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE 12:05 PM

Some significant volume at what COULD be a high. Volume the highest over the last 3 days of trading, but not exactly climactic in terms of the last two weeks of trading.

&#x200B;

If this is indeed a high, I would expect a retracement and then look for buying interest to come back in, hopefully.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 12:20 PM

https://preview.redd.it/dzjfymg04xc61.png?width=3519&format=png&auto=webp&s=48078c1df6bb3d41f5ef69edf3cb636fb08abe21

This is what significant volume looks like. 

However, as I am typing this price just broke this high volume candle.

Volume coming in but overwhelming demand it looks like steamrolling. Some big dick boomer just hit buy because his son on wsb convinced him.

"PayPal earnings, coming out February 3rd, will be mind-blowing!!!!",dd,38,0.91,l2ptn1,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2ptn1/paypal_earnings_coming_out_february_3rd_will_be/,19,"We have seen a tremendous rise in the price of (the asset that starts with a B and can't be named on this forum) immediately following the launch of PayPal's (""B"") offering. Many people used PayPal to buy ""B"" during the run up in December (PayPal had a large social media marketing push too).

Unlike Square, PayPal has almost no cost associated with their B offering. They partnered with Paxos who is the custodian exchanging the B and managing the accounts. PayPal is just reselling Paxos' product and taking a fee on top. Easy to implement, provides a large new revenue stream, and 0 risk for PayPal.

When Square posted its earnings following a B rally last year, Square stock skyrocketed and analysts raised their targets. I predict we will see even greater returns for PayPal.

I just put half my stack on PayPal call options expiring Feb 5th. Yolo!!!

As requested by Dan:

Most of it is in a $247.5 Call 2/5 at a limit price $11.10

and a little bit in a $285 Call 2/5 limit price $2.02

I also have a $240 call expiring 4/16 and a $260 call expiring 1/21/22. I plan on holding these for a while tho as I think PayPal has a lot of room to grow off the B play.",2021-01-22 23:21:13,

DD - NCLH: Room for Growth,,1,1.0,l2pvo7,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2pvo7/dd_nclh_room_for_growth/,1,"There is some serious opportunity with NCLH right now, it’s made significant progress since the bottom of the pandemic, but it’s still at less than half its price since pre-COVID. I’ve been in and out of the stock and made some good money since the initial drop, but I’m now going long (6 months - year) for the following reasons:

1. Room for growth: as mentioned, it has rebounded some, but still less than half its original price. Unlike some other stocks that will never make it back to pre pandemic levels due to market disruption (think movie theaters, etc.) this one cannot be replaced with a ‘virtual experience’. Additionally, this one had a great upward trend and growth before the pandemic. If things can return to semi-normal, I see performance following the same pattern. 

2. Pent up Demand: yes, this is going to be demo-specific. But for people who have been vaccinated and/or just don’t care about corona that much, I see an explosion in bookings once things are able to get going again. Most of the delays to cruising at this point are being self imposed by NCLH, as opposed to the government, which is a good sign. Once we see critical mass for vaccinations, I see this thing booming.

3. Cash Reserves: NCLH has large cash reserves to weather another year or so of no-cruising, without any new financing or cuts. Yes, the pandemic could rage for another year, but I think we’re going to see much bigger and more widespread problems if that happens.

4. Politics: This one is iffy, but I really believe Trump was a bit of a scapegoat for Rona..yea it happened on his watch, but how much better would anyone really have done? Anyway...I truly believe now that Sleepy Joe is in, the media will start making everything ‘good news’ about the virus. This, combined with the increased vaccinations, will make for some great gains on pure hype alone over the coming months.

GME - Short Squeeze Power Level 9000,dd,225,0.97,l37z5e,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37z5e/gme_short_squeeze_power_level_9000/,112,"

**Attention retards:** After Friday's short bloodbath I wanted to see if we'd made it through the squeeze for now and if all the low-hanging fruit had been shaken out. **Apparently not.** In fact, it's looking even harder for the shorts to borrow now.

Since [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) only updates once a day in the morning for GME, I went to IBKR to check to see if the data there was more current. Turns out that yes, it had updated as of 1/23 and lo and behold, our **power level is 9000.**

**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**GME|USD|GAMESTOP CORP-CLASS A|36285627|XXXXXXXW1099|-32.6198|32.6998|9000|**

32% interest to borrow rate, 9000 shares available according to IBKR. That's $585,000 worth of available stock to short at Friday's closing price - 0.0129% of its total market cap.

According to the chart at [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), this was down from 1,200,000 shares as recently as 1/18, one of only 4 times in the last 3 months that many shares had been available. The squeeze last week plowed right through that firewall. Now it's gone.

**Reading the chart:** ""Outlined below is a snapshot of the sample file output which includes the stock symbol, currency of denomination, name, contract identifiers (IB’s and the ISIN), rebate & fee rates and shares available.""

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**What I think:** This is going to be a very long weekend for short sellers to think over whether they want to keep up their strategy. We could be looking at another monster squeeze in the next week if the momentum continues and the big boys start unloading their positions. The pressure cooker hasn't even been turned on yet - my thinking is that we're heading to the Oort Cloud.

**Disclaimer:** I \*assume\* most ITM calls that get exercised this week aren't going to be available to short following the weekend - although I could be wrong.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**By way of comparison:**

Major stocks Berkshire Hathaway and Bank of America have basically unlimited shares to borrow at 0.25% interest. Blackberry has 4.1 million available at 0.35%. Palantir has 1.3 million available with a much higher 7.1% rate.

Unlike the housing market crisis in 2008 when social media was archaic to what we have today, 2021 
social media provides instant access to provide information to other people. Information like u/deepfuckingvalue is readily available to dumbasses like us. We’re able to see Michael Burrys stake in GameStop. Stuff like this wasn’t readily known in 2008 by retail investors.

Ultimate SPCE DD - 3rd Grade Reading Level Post,dd,277,0.94,l3oi5p,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3oi5p/ultimate_spce_dd_3rd_grade_reading_level_post/,92,"Crossposting a post I made yesterday with some long-form thoughts on the future of Virgin Galactic stock. I've held 1000 shares since a $9 share price and consider myself very well informed on the stock. Take it or leave it, but it's my theory that we're due for a solid run provided we see a powered test flight in the next two or three weeks, which I believe we will. Obvious caveat is it's a risky stock and you shouldn't buy stock without doing your own research etc, etc.

TL;DR:

* Multiple near term catalysts
* Test flight preparations underway, appears imminent
* Approaching all time highs, with huge short interest
* Possible inclusion in ARKX
* Further translation for those unable to read: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

***The post:***

Wanted to put some thoughts together on what we've seen over the last week, and why I'm feeling very excited about the next few weeks. I hope this will provide some value to folks reading, and serve as a refresher or at least a quick reality check as to where we are.

For starters, the stock price of the company is sitting in the mid $34s, and from a technical perspective is looking pretty strong. Aside from the Virgin Orbit news which is totally unrelated but still tends to be a nice little bump. For context this is an increase of $10 in share price over ***just the last two weeks.*** It also happens to have begun this run around January 7th, which is the date the company confirmed they have identified the problem from the first test flight, and that corrective action was underway.

The $34 may seem normal at the moment, but it's worth remembering that the last time the share price was this high was in February of 2020. We haven't seen these heights for close to a year now, and we're back, but with profoundly different circumstances.

If you follow Richard Branson's media appearances, you know that in a recent interview about Virgin Orbit he said that Virgin Galactic tests would resume ""in the next very few weeks"". Obviously Richard is Richard, and you can find video of him saying similar things going back to 1937, but with the recent test flight, and more recently VMS Eve hitting the New Mexico skies today and yesterday, I think it's fairly certain that that timeline is accurate.

***On November 3rd,*** [VMS Eve took off twice on some routine training flights](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1323628810080837646?s=20)***. Keep that in mind.***

The original test flight (that was cancelled due to COVID restrictions) was [announced on November 5th, and scheduled for November 19th-23rd](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1324463611402739716?s=20). From the 5th to the 13th, the share price rose $3 on that news alone before the test flight was officially [cancelled](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1328309312666669060?s=20). It took a small drop, and built back up gradually as the company made it clear they'd reschedule as soon as restrictions were eased. Investors shook it off.

The last flight window was [announced on December 1st](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1333906807379652616?s=20), and opened on December 11th, 2020 and prior to that the stock price reached $33.80 by December 7th, purely off the hype for the test flight. Obviously that price cooled down after the abort, but it's important to realize that we are now above the place we were with the last test flight ***before a launch window announcement has even been made***.

This is all to say, the stock is in a very strong position, and with [the two flights from VMS Eve this week](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1352330285422161923?s=20) we're seeing strong signals from the company that a test flight window announcement is ***imminent***. [On 1/21 the FCC granted them permission to use the frequencies they typically use during full powered tests](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_276754710.png), with a window extending until May.

The timeline on the announcement is unclear, but it seems likely to me that it could be either this coming week or the one after that. Should we get an announcement, it wouldn't be surprising to see the share price grow another $2 or $3, possibly more if folks are feeling particularly bullish.

After the announcement, based on the last two windows I'd imagine the actual flight will take place 10-15 days later. Virgin Galactic has yet to go to space as a publicly traded company, so it's hard to know what the result of a successful test flight would do to the stock, but I'd suspect it wouldn't exactly make it go \*down\* lol.

Add on to that, fourth quarter earnings call is [February 25th](https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Date-of-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results-and-Conference-Call/default.aspx) \- VG loves to announce new stuff before or after earnings. Assuming the first test flight happens, and succeeds before then it will be a huge opportunity for leadership to boast the success of the platform, announce the next test date, and even possibly roll out the new Spaceship Two ([projected that it will be complete Q1/early Q2](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1324463980002365446?s=20)). These things will also be positive catalysts.

It's unclear what the time between test flight two and the Branson flight will be, but I'd imagine the stock will continue to grow, or trade sideways until that point.

What I haven't mentioned yet is short interest. Second only to Gamestop, Virgin Galactic is a MAGNET for shorts. Current [short percent of float is 81%](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=spce&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2), and as the price continues to rise, more and more short interest will accumulate as people think a lot of the things you probably read on Reddit about the stock. Combine consistent, positive catalysts and a very memeworthy industry it will squeeze.

All of this to say, if you've held this long, this is as close to our collective vision's realization as we've ever really been. Of course things could go wrong at any point here, or a test flight could fail, or yeah, they could drag their feet on an announcement and the stock could gradually whittle down from where it is now - but I think that the point is the bull case here is as strong as its ever been as far as I'm concerned.

Do your own research, make your own decisions, and don't make any decisions based off of stuff you read on the internet as always, but I thought I'd lay out my bull case here.",2021-01-24 08:33:00,

GME - Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick,question,548,0.96,l3ore9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3ore9/gme_speak_softly_and_carry_a_big_stick/,116,"Alright my fellow mouthbreathers (for real breathe through your nose) -  I want to round out a few thoughts I had while daydreaming about (edging to) Gamestop all day. Stay with me here - I'm drunk off shitty beer because I'm loaded to the fookin tits on GME and anyway I still drink like I'm in college, but I digress.

The actual points:

1. Ryan Chewy has epitomized ol' Teddy's quote to a tee with single emoji tweets and even deleted some of the more erotic ones. I believe this is the ideal way for WSB to act as well, but as we are far past that with twitter and the talking heads on to us - this brings me to point 2.
2. Gamestop has received an incredible amount of free advertising over the past few months - this will only continue with the squeeze and feels similar to the free advertising for Tesla by resident meme lord Elon. I took a look at google trends but it doesn't work like robinhood with the green and red and so I couldn't read if it's up or down (**If anyone is in marketing or some shit and has any good ideas for getting a rough value for impressions created in the past months please share**)
3. Reversal of the negative GME stigma - I know we all got fucked out of our used games with shitty prices once upon a time and that kind of badwill is something a lot of bears bring up. With the amount of retail investors in gme, I think this has been more than counteracted by the good vibes of riding a rocket to the moon and taking out the big bad hedgies. I've personally converted at least my family from buying gaming shit from big box stores by getting them a pro membership and showing how they will undoubtably save money. **This will 10x with RC's focus on the customer's experience over all else.**

TLDR: Bears going extinct, GME to continue up bigly, we should all calm the fuck down and wait patiently for RC to use that big stick of his and act like we've been here before.

Edit: One last thought, I keep seeing people talk about current price and what if big guys get out etc. and I was definitely worried about this for a while when gme was hovering around 20. I read something though and am now more confident at 60 than I was then - This long/short battle feels like a zero-sum game and investors love The Art of War, Meditations, etc. - Essentially this is war and the big guys feel they have other guys bent over a barrel in addition to what I believe is a good-to-great growth turnaround story and chance by RC and crew",2021-01-24 08:47:39,

NVAX UPDATE 🚀 :: LIFTOFF SOON :: 🚀,question,25,0.64,l43i6t,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l43i6t/nvax_update_liftoff_soon/,28,"Fellow NVAX holders, new information has come to light through an 8k filing by NVAX on Friday:

“””
Between November 10, 2020 and January 20, 2021, the Company sold 3.6 million shares of its common stock resulting in $466.8 million in net proceeds at a weighted average sales price of $131.95 per share pursuant to its At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with the Sales Agent, dated as of November 10, 2020 (the “November 2020 Sales Agreement”), leaving $27.2 million remaining under the November 2020 Sales Agreement as of January 20, 2021. The Company and the Sales Agent terminated the November 2020 Sales Agreement by mutual agreement on the date hereof.
”””

So the reason we haven’t seen a run up to data release is because they were selling shares at $132. 

The company also filed for AN ADDITIONAL $500MM ATM offering. 

**************************************************

NVAX has added a supply chain exec and a regulatory exec, refreshed their ATM offering for an additional 500MM. 

News is coming soon. 

The pop may be dampened or may experience a dip on market open when it happens.

Watching the MSM shit on grassroots autists shows just how in bed they are with these hedge funds and wall street. They continue to try and downplay and discredit the pure autism that is this subreddit.

 I have been a long time lurker of WSB and have noticed several points:

1. There are a lot of very smart, VERY autistic people in this thread that give incredible DD; and
2. There are TENS OF THOUSANDS of hype-beasts that are itching to YOLO their entire bank account into stonks. If the DD fits, we sits.

I couldn't be MORE HYPED for all you degenerates in GME (I paper handed hard, in at $40, out at $111. I'm a bitch, I know).

Make me proud, show these pretentious 'journalists' and fat cats just how powerful the retail trader is.

An update on market conditions

HI ""redacted"",

It’s been a tough day, and we’re grateful to you for being a Robinhood customer. In light of the extraordinary market conditions this week, we temporarily limited buying for certain securities this morning. Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. 

This was a temporary decision made to best continue serving you, and was not an easy one to make. We know it’s led to frustration and confusion, and wanted to provide some clarity.

As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.

To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.

The past year in particular has shown us that the financial markets are for everyone—not just institutional investors and hedge funds. We’ve seen a new generation enter the market, and they’re sparking conversations about what it means to be an investor. We stand in support of you, our customers. Democratizing finance for all means giving more people access, not less.

We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and will update this Help Center article with the latest changes. We also published a blog post regarding today’s events.

Thank you again for being a Robinhood customer. We’re so grateful for your support.

Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team""

You sit around a fireplace with your children on a cold winter's eve. They are not related to you by blood, but you have decided to raise them. Your wife and her boyfriend are on their monthly date, and won't be coming home anytime soon.

""Let me tell you all a story that took place 19 years ago. We called it, the squozening,"" you start, as you sip from your martini glass filled with yellow Gatorade. It's a tale you've told them countless times. Your autism prevents you from hearing the sarcasm in their voice. You're convinced they like hearing about it.

""... and that's how it happened. Shares rose to an ATH of $69,420 as shorts scrambled to cover their positions. I was indeed a bagholder as CNBC had so warned. A bag worth millions,"" you smugly finish off. Your children are browsing memes in their heads, not listening to a word.

It's time for dinner. You decide to take the kids to Wendy's for old times' sake. To avoid social interaction, you go via the drive-thru. You order four tendies, and tell them to make them extra crispy. You like extra crispy.

As you drive around to collect your food, you hear a sound from behind the dumpster. Could it be? You roll your window down and hear grunts. You drive further up and see the silhouette of 4 large men and 1 skinny dude.

You recognize the skinny dude. It's Gabe! He's been working extra shift behind this dumpster since 19 years ago, and you see that his middle-out technique has been perfected over the years.

You collect your food from the window and reach for a tendie as you drive off. You bite into it. It's extra crispy, just like you wanted.

""Heh, winner winner chicken dinner,"" you mutter to yourself, as you drive off into the distance.",2021-01-29 07:00:34,

YOU FUCKIN WRONG CAUSE WE GOT SOME HOMIES ON DECK ROBINHOODS JUST A SMALL INDIE COMPANY COMPARED TO THEM

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Do the the skeptical claims about GME even make sense?,question,338,0.93,lbi6em,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbi6em/do_the_the_skeptical_claims_about_gme_even_make/,78,"Alright, I'm not going to pretend that I have a deep understanding of finance, but some of the comments expressing skepticism about GME reek of pure bullshit. Here's some of the recent claims I've been seeing.

**1. The shorts have covered!**

The poster usually cites the massive drop in SI as reported by S3. Something like \~120% going into Friday, down to \~51% going into Monday. So, from a basic supply & demand analysis, this doesn't add up. Volume was relatively low compared to Mo/Tues/Wed and the prior week, most likely due to heavy restrictions (or outright bans) on buying GME shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues. If it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positions—purportedly \~70%—on Friday, then we would've seen a massive hike in price because shorts would've been scrambling to buy, along with the few institutional/retail investors who weren't restricted from buying. This basically would've been the squeeze. But that's not what happened. The price did increase, yes, but it didn't massively spike, not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares *en masse,* as is being claimed.

**2. Sure, but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top, that's why the price didn't spike to squeeze levels!**

No, this can't be correct. If enough new short positions were opened Friday to artificially suppress and ""hide"" the supposed *massive* covering of short positions, then the SI reported by S3 would not have gone down—at least, it would not have decreased from \~120% to 51%. At this point, claims 1 and 2 aren't even compatible. They can't both be true at the same time. My guess is shorts have been ""averaging up"" their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion. Everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens, so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up, cover most of their positions (even if it were possible in this short time period) and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down. It would seem more likely that the SI hasn't actually decreased much at all, much less over the past 4 trading days.

**3. The shorts closed/are closing their positions this week! (Mo/Tues)**

Again, I don't see how this would work. How could shorts be closing *en masse* while the stock price is in free fall, like it has been the last two days? When shorts close their shorted shares, they buy the stock. So, if the claim is that they've been closing their earlier short positions this week, then shouldn't we realistically have seen an increase in price? Especially with Monday's low volume? At the very least, the price should've stabilized, not plummeted.

It seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while SI supposedly plummeted **and** without the price spiking to infinity, especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them.  One or more of these claims has to be false, right?

Maybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppress/crash the price simultaneously. In that case, SI should've stayed relatively stable or gone up, not crash from previous estimates.

If the SI really did crash, meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions, then price should've erupted.

If we just ignore the estimated SI entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago, and the spike at the AH last week was ""the squeeze."" That doesn't make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention? Between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze, the price would've exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck would've been selling at that point? What seems more likely is that the AH was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors, both retail and institutional.

Hopefully someone can explain what I'm missing because I feel like I'm going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half.  I realize there are legitimate concerns regarding GME moving forward, but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable. Am I just retarded?   💎🙌",2021-02-03 15:18:44,

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy the fucking dip and HOLD FFS. Stay the course.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Short Stocks and Dividend Payments 

Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.

1 -﻿ If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $512.00 there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.

&#x200B;

2﻿ - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.

&#x200B;

3 -﻿ In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.

Special Considerations:

Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.

&#x200B;

Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually. **30% in exceptional cases**.

&#x200B;

4﻿ -﻿ Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally, **BASIC MATH** works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product. 

&#x200B;

US Marijuana Legalization: the next rocket catalyst,question,177,0.86,lc1g07,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc1g07/us_marijuana_legalization_the_next_rocket_catalyst/,117,"**Bubbles**
An emergence of a new industry usually results in a bubble due to the necessity of making a lot of assumptions about future growth to value a stock since there is no historical precedent. The enthusiasm for a paradigm shift causes investors to frequently overshoot and result in what may be quite astronomical valuations. Currently, the US equities market is quite frothy with unprecedented loose monetary policy causing an asset bubble of historic proportions. Jeremy Graham calls the US equities the biggest bubble he has ever seen in his investing career.  With the Democrats in charge of government, the corresponding stimulus bill will result in a melt up of the stock market along with risky equities. 

**Government Involvement** 
Government policy and actions can ignite a bubble. Chinese EV stocks were in the dumps during March 2020 due to the Covid shut downs, and the curtailment by the Chinese government of EV subsidies. NIO was on the verge of bankruptcy with only having enough cash to sustain its payrolls for 2 months at the time. But the subsequent 180 from the government for EV subsidies along with a partnership with a local government entity caused NIO to skyrocket. 

We are already in an environment of risk seeking, frothy environment where a value play of a struggling retailer can turn into a short squeeze that ends up as a social moment. This is a crazy market, and it will get even crazier when Congress legalizes marijuana.

US marijuana legalization efforts has followed a similar path to gay marriage where the public opinion over the decade has shifted due to states leading the way for legalization followed by an increasingly favorable depiction in popular culture that has shifted public opinion. I believe we are on the verge of legalization now that the Democrats hold all positions of power in government, and they are willing to pass progressive policies after getting stung in the Obama administration for trying to negotiate a “bipartisan” path that went nowhere.  

**Political Calculus**
The House has already passed HR 3884 MORE Act of 2020 that pretty much legalized marijuana. Schumer who is the current Senate Majority Leader, sponsored the S 1552 Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act in 2019, but it went nowhere since McConnell ran the show at the time. Legal marijuana is Schumer’s pet legislation he has been pushing for years, and he is under pressure to enact progressive legislation due to threats of other progressives running against him in the 2022 primary. He will most likely push to get it passed in the Senate before his primary so that he can parade it in his re-election campaign and kill any progressive challenges to his seat. 

Marijuana stocks have done well since the election, but I think they have more room to go due to the following reasons. Once legalization happens, a couple of things happen. 

1.    **Institutional money.** US banks and institutional investors cannot invest in a company that produces a product that is federally illegal. However, once legalization happens, the barrier no longer applies. You will have a flood of institutional funds buying up companies operating in a grey zone (hence my preference for US based MSOs compared to more mainstream Canadian companies). 

2.	**Taxes.** Currently, IRS does not allow medical marijuana companies to deduct their business expenses so most of them are operating at a loss despite 50-70% gross margin. Once marijuana is legalized, their tax bill will no longer cause them to operate at a loss. 

3.	**Availability.** US MSO who have the biggest to gain from this are trading in Canadian stock exchanges in a quasi-grey area. Once they become legalized, they can move into main stream stock exchanges like NYSE which can open them up to retail investors to trade in. 

4.	**Financing.** The best US MSO can only get a 10% rate for their financing needs in order to expand due to the lack of banks willing to do business with them because of the ambiguity in the federal guidelines. When the restriction is lifted, their financing costs will go down and their payment processing fees/ availability will improve.

Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),question,6901,0.94,lfxux0,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxux0/stuff_for_new_traders_no_gme_discussion/,665,"I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

May the gains be with you",2021-02-09 16:11:06,

What is the future of WSB?,question,289,0.77,lgll5j,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgll5j/what_is_the_future_of_wsb/,294,"I miss what was left of the old WSB culture before 7 million new subscribers in a month obliterated it into some sort of virtual Occupy Wallstreet. 

I'm not trying to be a whiny bitch about it, but I think it's worth discussing where we go moving forward, or whether old WSB is just dead and we're at the whims of the overwhelming majority of fresh meat.

I see people who don't get the concept of yolo and think this is some sort of investing forum or collective get rich quick scheme, and sadists who think it's a place to *""egg people on into doing a stupid bet then laughing at the results""*.  Maybe I'm wrong, but to me none of that has ever been WSB.

I'm not trying to gatekeep the culture, I wasn't here at the start although I have been around on and off for more than 5 years, and I think of WSB as a place where we make or become market memes, and occasionally share an intelligent high risk bet, or the large gains/losses from one. 

A place where there's more discussion than *""I like the stock""* - often using leverage or options in ways that will lose a novice money. A place where money is taken lightly and no one is gambling their house even if they are putting hundreds of thousands on the line.

I don't really care if people want to keep holding Gamestop in hopes of triggering a short squeeze to a million, if they can do it that's fine, but there's no finesse to pressing the buy button on a stock and honestly it's kind of boring compared to past plays. DFV's play was interesting and WSB worthy because he came up with a thesis, had conviction and posted the results, and along the way he didn't just buy stock he also flipped options to make like $13+ million in addition to the stock he was holding. Excellent content.

I'm curious to hear what other people who have been around here for more than 6 months think as well. Is there any way to keep the old culture, is it a lost cause with so much new blood, or maybe you even like the new evolution of WSB?

Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,dd,12086,0.94,lglrg5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/,1339,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

Edit 2: A [compelling theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lglkwv/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/gmsll2k/) put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read

I've been a longtime lurker on this sub since it was <1m degenerates, finally clicked the join button around Dec/Jan. It's great to see many new redditors take an interest in WSB, but for the love of Elon Musk, **READ THE POSTING GUIDELINES AND STOP MAKING THINGS UP!!!**

There is a case for GME, given the new CEO/CTO, console cycle, and massive short interest/short position (even at the real 42-43% SI and 21m SP). Those are factual events and numbers. What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail. It's another thing to **not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers** because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.

# Let me put it into context:

&#x200B;

|GME Price|Market Cap|Comparable |
|:-|:-|:-|
|$1000|69.7B|BP, Twilio, Anthem|
|$10000|697B|Alibaba, Visa + MC, JP Morgan + Wells Fargo |
|$69420|4,789,980,000,000|25% US Annual GDP, Apple + Microsoft + Amazon|

When you dispute data from Bloomberg Terminal, the holy grail of Wall Street trading, you've lost the investing game. It's not even a casino-level bet, it's throwing cash into a fire pit and pouring piss martinis over it. Don't downvote someone because they disagree with your reality, challenge them. We all have opinions, and we can think the other degenerate's opinion is flat out dumb. But if your DD doesn't hold water, then it truly is dumb.

# tl;dr It's great you love GME as a stock, I hope they do great and think they'll make a great turnaround. Just don't be untethered from reality, follow posting guidelines, and don't make up data",2021-02-11 04:25:52,

It Ipo’d at $17 and went through fraud last year tanking the share price from $50 to $1. 

It then recovered all the way to $14 over this last year. 

Once again after a change of management. All stores in operations still, it declared chapter 15 bankruptcy and took the stock price from 14 to 5 just because the word bankruptcy scared people without most knowing the difference with a chapter 15 and chapter 7 or 11.

I just bought 50k worth yoloing at $6 each and wondering what you guys think of Luckin Coffee and it’s possible revival/re-listing to Nasdaq. If they still have cash on hand and all stores running and a few months back the company stated half the stores are profitable, shouldn’t it be way higher then IPO price from 2 years ago?

$OPEN - DISRUPTING THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY 🚀🚀,dd,23,0.6,likqvz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/likqvz/open_disrupting_the_real_estate_industry/,101,"TL;DR 📈📈📈 SHARES CALLS LEAPS ETC. MONTHS OUT YEARS OUT WHO CARES WILL 🚀🪐💫

Disclosure: this was all taken and edited from u/krush0910 who wrote an extensive dd and you retards missed it - also I’m not an investment advisor 

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings, fixing up their house or repair negotiations, buyer’s demands, doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama, have to deal with realtors, or even pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%) Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.
Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could be valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market. As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on the original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**CONCERNS:**

**WHAT ABOUT THE CRASH COMING WE ARE IN A BUBBLE**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Assets. This simply can't happen anymore at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

**WHAT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND IMPENDING CLOSURES**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**ISN’T THIS JUST UBER FOR HOUSES**

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies other than just their software like DoorDash, Uber, etc... 

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.

Inminent bull run for the Uranium market?,dd,376,0.84,ljiul3,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljiul3/inminent_bull_run_for_the_uranium_market/,298,"# The world needs clean-air energy

There is growing recognition of the role nuclear power must play in providing safe, reliable, affordable carbon-free baseload electricity and achieving a low-carbon future. Examples of this growing recognition include:

* Many countries, US states, and utilities announced net-zero carbon targets in 2020. While most of these targets are further out in the future, many of the plans include an important role for nuclear. For example, a study suggests that for China to achieve its net-zero target by 2060, will require a 382% increase in nuclear power from 2025 levels.
* In the US, President Biden’s campaign included positive statements about the need to maintain the existing nuclear power fleet and to build advanced reactors as part of an overall shift to non-emitting carbon power sources.
* Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, announced that the country aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. Regarding nuclear, he indicated Japan will continue to develop its nuclear energy supply with “maximum priority on safety”. Japan’s current energy plan calls for 20% to 22% nuclear by 2030.
* In France, President Macron stated in December that nuclear will remain a pillar of the French energy mix for decades to come and pressed for preparatory studies on new next-generation EPR reactors to be wrapped up in the coming months.
* The Netherlands announced they will begin a process that considers building up to 10 nuclear power plants.
* According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are currently 443 reactors operating globally and 52 reactors under construction. With a number of reactor construction projects recently approved, and many more planned, the demand for uranium is growing.

# Supply-Demand

Like other commodities, **the uranium industry is cyclical.** History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production. Once that production is in the market, it tends to stay in the market longer than is economically rational, creating the perception that uranium is abundant and always will be, and prices decline. When prices are declining and low, like we have seen over the past number of years, there is no perceived urgency to contract, and contracting activity and investment in new supply drops off. **After years of low investment in supply, as has been the case since 2011, security of supply tends to overtake price concerns at some point, and utilities re-enter the long-term market to ensure they have the reliable supply of uranium they need to run their reactors.**

Customers do not go to the market right before they need to load uranium into their reactors. To operate a reactor that could run for more than 60 years, natural uranium and the downstream services have to be purchased years in advance, allowing time for a number of processing steps before it arrives at the power plant as a finished fuel bundle. The longer the recovery of the long-term market is delayed, the less certainty there will be about the availability of future supply to fill growing demand. **Recent data from the US Energy Information Administration shows that utility inventories are starting to decline and are approaching levels that could put security of supply at risk, there is a significant amount of uranium that needs to be contracted to keep reactors running into the next decade.**

As utilities’ uncovered requirements grow, annual supply declines, demand for uranium from producers and financial players increases, and with trade policy potentially restricting access to some markets, the pounds available in the spot market will not be adequate to satisfy the growing backlog of long-term demand. As a result, **there will be increased competition to secure uranium under long-term contracts on terms that will ensure the availability of reliable primary supply to meet growing demand.**

Global population is on the rise, and there is a growing focus on electrification and decarbonization. With the world’s need for safe, clean, reliable baseload energy, nuclear remains an important part of the energy mix. With demand increasing due to restarts and new reactors, and supply becoming less certain as a result of low prices, production curtailments, lack of investment, and end of reserve life, unplanned production disruptions, shrinking secondary supplies and trade policy issues, a market transition is expected.

I was berated for communicating my new strategy for risk management... then accused of being a Melvin plant. So now I present to you why your information about short interest is meaningless.,question,0,0.42,ljj6au,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljj6au/i_was_berated_for_communicating_my_new_strategy/,71,"There are other ways for short positions to cover aside from buying the stock at the current value, and any data should not persuade you.
 
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let's say I short a stock at 5 dollars. If there was a huge increase in the stock I could again short the stock at the highest point. When it drops, the money I make from that transaction would cover multiple short positions that were originally at 5 dollars. Say I took action to cover at 300/share. Only a week later it's at 50/share. I can now cover 5 of those losing short positions for the loss of my profit on that trade (which puts me effectively at zero) since there was a net profit of 250 on that single trade when it closed.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

There may still be short positions, but they are there to ""cover"" other short positions. Let me give you two examples in trading call and put options.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1) I believe the market will go up, and want to make a safe marginal premium while I wait. I sell one call option above with strike price above the stock price, and buy another with strike price considerably lower than the one I sold (and below the stocks market price). Now I got a call option on a discount, theirs is above the current value of the market (more likely to expire), and I get to keep my valuable call option or exercise it before it's near expiry.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2) I believe the market will go down. I sell one call option with strike price close to the stock price (but still above), then buy another one with a much higher strike price(this one can be far out of the money). If the market does go down I lose the price of the call option I bought, but I have a net premium in the end. 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The question you need to ask yourself is this: if some random dude on the internet could understand repositioning after only trading for two weeks, why don't you think hedge funds could?

In one week ending this past Wednesday, $22.9 billion flowed into stock funds.

This has been the biggest weekly inflow since March 2008.

In 2008, after big inflows into the stock market happened, the stock market crashed. Most well-structured conservative portfolios lost one-half of their value. Momentum stocks lost 80 - 95% of their value.



Stock Funds See Biggest Inflows Ever as BofA Warns Top Is Near


BofA’s gauge of market sentiment-- the so-called Bull &amp; Bear indicator-- is approaching levels of extreme bullishness, which can trigger a sell signal that hasn’t been set off since January 2018, according to the note.

# 

&#x200B;

Alright- I posted a position in Trivago on Friday and I wanted to follow up with a list of reasons why I think Trivago could be a great play for 2021. For those that know about Trivago, it essentially serves as a price comparison tool for multiple travel sites and it allows you to book hotels.  This is a recovery play that may or may not pan out, I believe that the floor for Trivago is probably around 2.00 right now so you may see those prices should this fail to pan out. Also, Expedia is a large owner in Trivago and Trivago is a European based company. Trivago is a cost per click business that essentially puts multiple pricing on the same site and lets the customer compare. With Leisure travel picking back up and companies desperate for cashflow, Trivago might find companies being more aggressive on customer acquisition. Trivago may benefit with these surges.

I am buying shares and selling covered calls A 5.00. I believe 5.00 is my exit price for the stock as of right now. If something big happens like an adjacent expansion then this might move, but I am going to sell monthly covered call @ 5.00.

# Beaten Down Stocks Respond Aggressively to good news

* Often time stocks that are at all time lows just need a single small catalyst to respond aggressively to the upside.
   * Gamestop's investment from Ryan Cohen is an example of a catalyst that drove a huge increase in Gamestop's game price.
* A few years ago Trivago was trading at \~23.00 dollars per share. As of Friday it was trading around 3.00, an 87% decrease. As of two years ago, it was in the mid to high single digits.
* Revenue has steadily declined for a few years and the pandemic itself was no help.
   * A new large partnership, or an adjacent product category expansion like airline travel or car rentals are a potential catalyst.
* The recovery will begin mid year

* The overall travel industry is expecting a big summer.
   * I expect short term that bids on cost per click will be higher as the industry fights to win the consumer battle to improve cash flow.

# Pent up demand, stimulus, oil prices and desperate airlines might make travel boom this year and a strong start for 2022.

* Everyone is ready for a vacation, period, end of story.
* The airline industry is struggling and they are desperate for cash flow. Airlines will have reason to push for low cost or at cost flights to ensure they are maximizing their cash flow on their assets,
* Airlines are going to most likely focus on efficiency this year and continue to have less flights with higher occupancy.
* Studies are showing that the pandemic has pushed people to the point where they will travel and this summer could set records.

* Oil prices are lower than they have been in a while, might be a nothing burger as they have started to accelerate as of late.

&#x200B;

# Larger Companies like Trivago actually come out stronger after a pandemic like event.

* Small travel agencies are closing their doors. 70% of small agencies were in imminent danger of closing. I doubt 70% close, but some definitely will close.

# The Fundamentals and Comparison to Peers

* Price to sales is much better than Expedia
   * Trivago P/s = 2.59
   * Expedia = 4.00
* Financial Health is much better than Expedia
   * Trivago - 5 year cash flow growth of 26%+
   * Expedia - 5 year cash flow growth of 6.33%
* Burn Rate can be sustained for a few years of pandemic conditions.

* Trivago's largest customer base is not the USA, it's Europe. I am optimistic that Earnings will be improved due to the weakness of the dollar.

# TRIVAGO MANAGEMENT and LEANER Company

* Trivago has a healthy balance sheet of \~200M cash
* Trivago had a net loss of 9M last quarter
* Trivago can maintain suppressed travel for quite a while and their low capital business model can flex quickly.

# RISKS

**There are Risks- Trivago has seen revenue decline even pre pandemic, this is a play that assumes Trivago emerges stronger, that their new CEO has growth plans, that emerging markets play a significant role in the coming years and that other potential adjacent expansion happens. I believe Trivago can do well, even just firing their pedophile spokesman might do wonders for their branding.**

They just had a nice pullback after beating earnings expectations. Load up.  This one isn’t a rocket ship, but it will get you 30% by spring.",2021-02-14 15:00:59,

GET OUT OF $SLV NOW IF YOU ARE LONG SILVER !,news,1493,0.85,lkgtyx,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkgtyx/get_out_of_slv_now_if_you_are_long_silver/,557,"[Video explaining what's going on](https://streamable.com/j3lgj5)

**I cannot stress it enough. Not only SLV is worthless paper, which is backed by...nothing, but it's actually used to SUPPRESS SILVER PRICES.**

I'll try to sum it up for retards :

* People buy SLV shares, making SLV buy silver and ship it to their vaults (sureeee...)
* Silver prices barely increase even though premiums are extremely high and bullion dealers are struggling to ship orders due to the massive demand.
* What's likely happening is that SLV didn't buy shit and is actually keeping your dollars...to guess what ? To buy silver when it's cheaper.
* But how is that called, when instead of buying something, you sell it and hope to buy it back at a lower price...mhm ? **That's right, shorting.**

# THAT'S FUCKING RIGHT. THEY MAY BE USING YOUR $SLV MONEY TO ACTUALLY SHORT SILVER. THEY'RE ACTING AGAINST YOUR INTEREST.

What ape do if silver go to moon ? Sell $SLV and then what buy?  🦍 ❓

* Safe bet : buying silver bullion. It's hard to find and you'll pay high premiums sadly. But it's the best way to actually make sure you have silver, because you're you're own bank. It's in your hands. This isn't a risky play at all.
* $PSLV (Sprott Physical Silver) is transparent on their silver and they show footage of delivery, etc. So it's actually backed by real silver. It's a closed end fund, which means they will not create new shares unless they take delivery of additional silver in their vaults.
* Buying miners shares. Now we're getting monkey YOLO. Junior miners tend to skyrocket when silver prices go up. They're a big leverage on silver prices. They can easily go 200% or so. 🚀 🚀
* Buying junior miners options. Very high IV, but the ultimate monkey play. Leveraging the fucking lever ! Extremely risky but extremely rewarding. 🚀

&#x200B;

This isn't financial advice of any sort. I'm not qualified to give any. I don't have tangible proof that SLV is doing that but neither do they have any fucking proof that they've been buying silver, especially since the price haven't skyrocketed like they should. **Silver, unlike gold, is a TIGHT market.**

Relevant positions : $SA and around 37 lbs of silver coins + 3 oz of gold in my pirate chest. Planning to buy calls on $SILJ as a small yolo play.  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Disclaimer : lots of junior miners are penny stocks and therefore not allowed to be posted on WSB.

This is a post to solicit advices from you guys on which miners and royalty companies to play with.

Take a look. Good DD, and I am in. That said, I think it is great to look ahead, and look beyond just steels, coppers, silver/gold.

We know EV is going to be the future, and we know there are raw materials needed for this pipeline. But, what is needed? Check this graph:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

OK, it does not matter if our smooth brain can understand how these metals and resources are used in the EV industry. What important is that, there will be a parabolic growth in demand! And more growth means $$$$.

Now how do we play with this? Here are just a few of my thoughts and you are welcome to post your findings. Let us start with some boring, 'safer' play, etfs:

LIT: lithium batteries miners and techs

BATT: similar to LIT.

COPX: you know copper :)

REMX: rare earth miners, mostly in China (no surprise).

However, I do think there are more tendies in these miners and royalty companies that most people don't pay attention to. For example, many graphite miners stocks have silently increase over the past year. I will give a few examples, which does not mean I approve them :0

Northern Graphite Corp: 178% in a year:

https://preview.redd.it/55ado2mtvsh61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0a7817cd3ee7ce520ce28e1b61d88db043b3ec

Mason Graphite Inc: 239%.

&#x200B;

etc. The point is, there are many of them, in graphite, cobalt, nickel that are making tendies right now! And our job is to find them. Find these with good mining potentials (which I have no idea).

Warning ahead: miners come with many risks (including geopolitical risks). So, another play is to find royalty companies such as WPM and FNV. What, you tell me you have no ideas what they mean? They are basically angel investors to the miner companies. They provide capital for the miners to explore, and in return take an agreed portion from the entire mine! And they invest in many different miners so their risk is reduced.  That said, I have no f\*\*\*ing idea about non-silver/gold royalty companies. If anyone find them, post your DD for tendies!

TLDR: long miners and royalty companies for great tendies!

Position:
FNV: ~7k
WPM: ~6k
FCX: ~3k

I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.,dd,40942,0.81,lkzviy,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/,2056,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",2021-02-16 16:54:09,

$HUYA The only undervalued tech stock?,dd,63,0.88,llni06,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llni06/huya_the_only_undervalued_tech_stock/,54," 1. Huya broke out of a multiyear resistance 

https://preview.redd.it/s26itvns6zh61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ab15bf07f4b44d4a105501569cbcefa57acf1a3

2. Already profitable with a 5 P/S ratio, which is low for the streaming market

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uuk1xv777zh61.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c24f0a2076ed0e3427138d16c2b9636806d53d

Using $Bili as a comparison, which is currently still unprofitable and has a 31 P/S

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b30o8x4f7zh61.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=76110644791fe71ea2d9adc9a8eae41855f356be

It's true that Bili is currently growing at a faster rate than HUYA, 70% as compared to 50%, however, this difference is huge, and I believe that HUYA can reach at least 10x P/S considering it is still a growing company.

&#x200B;

3. Institutional Holdings

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/njvxngvs7zh61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=b66722c00405d2213b12cb21fb35ffe71a43ce4a

Ark, MS, and Rentech heavily added positions in HUYA last quarter. A quick google search tells you that Tencent has a 37.2% stake in HUYA. Excluding companies below JOYY Inc. because the reports are old, we would get a total of 112.15% institutional holding. 

This is a similar situation to gamestop, although I don't this should be a short squeeze play, I think that a squeeze is very possible under the right conditions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c0x7iuwl8zh61.png?width=237&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0adadf065c2ce0dcae6356abba698250b46f3f

4. Potential merger with DOYU

If they do merge, DOYU would be a better play because the share exchange ratio would be HUYA\*0.73=What you get for each DOYU share, but DOYU is the riskier play in this situation if they don't merge because DOYU is consistently losing market share to HUYA in china.

Some quick DD on Chinese websites tell you that Chinese people tend to prefer HUYA

&#x200B;

[for those who can read chinese](https://preview.redd.it/iqtf91ie9zh61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=61b1cf344c2315601786593e28d6381486ee278a)

Even if this merger doesn't go through I see this as a very good tech ""value"" play

7. Chinese stock craze

The Chinese stock market has been going harder than the US market recently. There are many Chinese stocks that are breaking out. Some examples include FUTU, TIGR, BILI, TME, YY.

I believe HUYA could be next but this is pure speculation.

The last few trading days have seen 10-20% gains, so it's already getting pretty close on it's own.

If you never heard of this company before, the TLDR is they created a Saphyr system to map variations in genomes better than anything else.  Then they figured out it can do all kinds of stuff, like detecting covid variants, diseases, etc.  It's taking over market share rapidly. Saphyr is set for release in March and there's been nothing but positive news about this company and their product. 

It's been steady moving, but my prediction this week is that either Wed or Thur the price will jump enough to cause a gamma squeeze.  The company itself has solid fundamentals with their product being released, so I don't see it being dumped anytime soon either.  With technology like CRISPR, being able to map genomic variations is going to be critical in the next 5-20 years even.

PLTR Bullish Short Put Position (Informative),question,47,0.85,lm7imq,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm7imq/pltr_bullish_short_put_position_informative/,42,"Shorted the PLTR $25 put expiring 2/19/21.

I was writing an explanation of this trade to someone else, so I included it here.

Every option has a buyer and a seller on each side. By selling a put, I am creating a new put option and selling it on the open market. This put is a contract that gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares to me at $25 each. This put was cash secured, so I am using $2,500 as collateral for each put. I sold them for $53 each ($0.53 per share). If PLTR stays above $25.01 this week, then on Friday's close the trade will end, and I will get my $2,500 back as well as the $53 (2% return). However, if PLTR closes below $24.47 on Friday 2/19, then the buyer earns the difference. For example, if PLTR closes at $23.97, the buyer will purchase 100 shares on the open market and then sell them to me for $24.47 each. The buyer will earn $50, and I will own 100 shares at a $24.47 cost basis.

This derivative trade is essentially buying shares with a limit order at $24.47 where you are paid if it doesn't execute.

Positions: 20x 2/19 PLTR short put

A little Tendie Tip for AMD 🐥🍗🐔,dd,166,0.91,lmpclp,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmpclp/a_little_tendie_tip_for_amd/,64,"As AMD dominance continues to grow and compete in this semi land scape lets take a minute to look at just company valuations. 

With AMD only hovering at 100B i think it is SEVERELY undervalued

INTEL is double at 235B and Nvidia is triple at 350B

Positives: As the only chipmaker with the ability to produce x86 cpus and gpus, this has allowed AMD to create custom integrated solutions that has given them complete dominance over the console market. 

Xbox one, ps4, xbox series x, ps5, xbox one x

All this shit cant even stay on shelves.

Dont even get me started on oems

https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years

Amd surpassed intel for the first time in 15 years 


They are attacking nvidia and intel from both sides by providing much more consumer value.

Lets remember intel charges you extra for an overclockable chip and ram which is complete bullshit. 

With AMDs purchase of Xilinx it does dilute the stock however it only furthers AMD penetration in to the server market which intel has been heavily losing ground and thats where the big money is at.

Risks: China is the number one producer of silicon and is a one of the biggest risks as tensions between the US and china is growing fast over the uighurs situation. This is the biggest risk I see but i also don’t know if china is willing to shoot themselves in the foot by fucking over their silicon business

ALSO NICE DIP TO BUY INTO

TLRY and PLTR Speculation for Friday Based On My Own Extra Chromosomes! How Putting a Potato In Your Gameboy Shows Both MIGHT Still Dip Tomorrow!,dd,125,0.83,lnaemm,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnaemm/tlry_and_pltr_speculation_for_friday_based_on_my/,67,"All I can present is some data and charts on possible movements in price based off of market volumes swinging in similar manners. Want more details what everything means, check out my old posts referencing my super powers of autism!

**Basic Premise:**

* If different market short volumes start to rise and peak together, that stock dips the next day(s)

**What's Happening:**

* TLRY had the sync and peak happen already, but still has some to go.
* PLTR dived into an empty pool, and the short volumes should have backed off, but they've doubled down, and now they brought in pretty HIGH short exempt volumes

**What's it Mean Then:**

* TLRY could still fall!!!
* PLTR is in Round 5 of the ""Getting the Shit Beat Out of You"" competition, and def winning there, and we might be looking at Round 6 tomorrow before the judges call it.

&#x200B;

TLRY has had the short exempt volume drop significantly! THANK GOD! My only hesitation before buying into the dip is the slight rise on Thursday, look at the bright teal line. The short volumes do appear to be slightly rising going into Friday though, so expect some action in the near future.

https://preview.redd.it/kz8xuhh4pdi61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=069e9908bd7142eeb7d7fa8cf9d45cf46085eadf

I think we'll see TLRY fall below the $27 mark, and see support at $25. I think it'll hold, **HOWEVER, don't be surprised IF** we see a dip below that, there's still 1.5MILLION short exempts out there too for some more top-notch-fuckery.

https://preview.redd.it/0mvwewrwtdi61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=63afe390bff3bb0536093eee35f1301c94dc77fb

=============================================

For PLTR, the short exempt volume **hit a new high Thursday for this year**, and the short volumes from **FINRA and NASDAQ PSX both climbed!**

\--->  **THIS IS USUALLY A BAD SIGN!!!**

* See how the yellow line, off-exchange numbers from FINRA, dipped Wednesday, then went higher than Tuesdays!???
* And the bright blue(teal?) line is at its highest now, that's short exempts, which I have a personal history with because they usually shit themselves in elevators and walk out!

https://preview.redd.it/6fr1g0utmdi61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50125d21b35979a5d23d433a7219621541b9afa

https://preview.redd.it/twodqlhxtdi61.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e438aa5b7ef493f266c99f47c6cf0e0eef1586

I think we're going to see some real volatility tomorrow, down to $23 and if it can't hold there, then down to $22, AND PLEASE DEAR GOD MAKE IT THE FLOOR!

==============================

I believe, like many of you, that these two are are WAY UNDERVALUED! I've read estimates for TLRY to $60, and PLTR to $70, but you're reading this now, so who the hell knows!

==============================

&#x200B;

**TLDR: DON'T TRUST STRANGERS ONLINE!**

* Not financial advice, but **BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!!!**
* **TLRY** shorts look like they've finally beaten the hell out of it and their volumes fell Wednesday, but they also went up slightly Thursday, maybe preparing for another incoming dip, unclear at this point.
   * **Still might beat it down to $ 25 tomorrow** and if it gets down anywhere near $20 expect a rubberband in the future, and I'm trading in all my crayola's to buy in.
* **PLTR** has **gone down 5 days in a row BUT THE SHORT VOLUME HAS REMAINED HIGH?!** and the short exempt volume is the highest for all of 2021!
   * **PLTR isn't done falling,** and **short exempt volumes can drag out recovery.**
   * If that shit falls anywhere near $23 I'm selling my good kidney to get in there!
   * (**CHARLIE IN THE MAIN ROOM RANT**) IF THE SHORT EXEMPT VOLUMES GO DOWN tomorrow, expect a rise next Monday and Tuesday. IF they use them Monday, expect the price to stay low Monday also and recovery sometime next week. (**END WILD SPECULATION WITH NO PROOF)**

**EDIT For PreMorning:**

* 4:15am: TLRY -1%, PLTR +8%
* 6:10am: TLRY +3.7%, PLTR + 5.16%
* 8:30am: TLRY +2, PLTR +6.75%
* 9:25am: TLRY +2.88%, PLTR +6.75
   * So let's hope my post was completely wrong and we ride up to $50 for both

**EDIT: TinFoil Hat Theory:**

Premarket activities on the 16th were up, and so were short exempts, then we saw a MASSIVE sell off.What if the price is allowed to rise in premarket, then they flood it with sell orders they bought yesterday at lower prices, and you can use short exempts on the downticks too, further driving price down?--> Huge selloff early morning to try to scare people from buying in and driving price below $25 (where everyone thought safe)

Edit: Anyone else watching the candles at market open, because they're were FLYING up green, and then they just go to neutral?!",2021-02-19 15:57:43,

Don't think that because you lost money, or ""diDn'T mAkE enOuGh"" you don't have to file it.

You can file yourself or if you're feeling lazy, use TurboTax and most brokers have an auto-import option there. I know Robinhood and Fidelity do, not sure about others.

I won't link to them on here but you can find many stories on Reddit by people who didn't file taxes, did wash sales and all sorts of things that raise red flags with the tax man and you'll see it's all fun and games until it happens to you. Never go full retard.

Edit: shit I uhh, forgot these    

No pay taxes 💰? Uncle Sam will FUK 👉👌👉👌 YOU and rocket🚀go 💥 boom, not burrr.

Edit 2: since this is seeing some traction, I'll update with instructions on where to find documents for different brokers.

"Why GameStop was going to cause a collapse of the entire market, and why it is still going to:",dd,21806,0.93,lnvvu3,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/,4058,"**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice, and much of this information is not my own, sourced from other DD’s, many that have been removed.

As many of you know, on the 17th of this month, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview (Automod won't let me link it?) where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze.

*However, this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined.*

Tom (or should we go with Tommy?) goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock, as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market. While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let’s play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.

Tom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.

Vlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill.

Tom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural.

*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*

Finra’s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.

So, what is the true short interest then?

Well, let’s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%

If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024’s data, check out his DD.

***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \~432.56%.***

Last week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME’s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***

Now, I know, lol. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?

But I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world.

If SI really is \~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights.

https://preview.redd.it/1xlj4jhdcji61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1ae42ae38e27ff4f6b2b82d8cfe2ffe52654610

If this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock.

All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.

So now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don’t forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.

It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.

We are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.

So, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel.

💎🙌

Edit: Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also **admitted** that they halted to **save themselves**. Or the CNBC interview with Vlad where he said it multiple times assuredly that it **WAS NOT** a liquidity issue, but that is his reasoning now. (You can find these 2 interviews on youtube, AutoMod wont let me link youtube)

OZON stock play DD,dd,29,0.88,locd9f,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/locd9f/ozon_stock_play_dd/,29,"I entered a starter position around $46 after post ipo dip , regret not going in heavier . The more I research the stock the more I like.

What is $ozon? 

Ozon.ru is pretty much Amazon copy cat, that was around for years . I grew up in Russia, and back in a day they were just an online bookstore 

They IPOed this year , they didn't get much buzz, but it caught  my eye after realizing how much they grew. 

They are unprofitable as of right now , but they invested heavily into building up delivery system infrastructure to speed up delivery process. 

Thing I remember about Russia , is their mail system freaking sucks. Its like USPS but 100x worse . Can you imagine, cold Russia , and your mailman is some old woman who just carries mail (literally no truck , just old woman ) , that walks from post office on her two feet rain/snow and covers decent size area ( Район in Russian  ). 

So obviously express delivery is out of the question, so ozon builded up infrastructure of carriers, pick up locations,  warehouses in major cities .... so now they can cover most of the Russia with 2 day delivery without relying on Russian mail service, which is one smart investment .

So **how can we change the game**, just by asking your broker not to lend your shares especially the ones that you did not purchase with margin money. So here is what we should do now -

1. Move highly shorted stocks i.e GME to a brokerage which can stop the lending i.e Fidelity or TD Ameritrade.
2. Email or call them to stop them to lend your current and futures shares.
3. Also many brokerage buy stocks on margin automatically even if you have liquid. So if you are not planning to use margin trading ask your brokerage to switch off margin trading. They will still allow you to trade options.

Remember, **brokerage are not your your side**. They will do all kindof stuff to your stock behind your back. If majority of retail traders stops lending their share it may potentially lead to all kind of situation which is previously unheard of. So, in order to give yourself a chance in this so called free market please reach out to your brokerage and ask them to stop lending your shares.

&#x200B;

I am a degenerate gambler who now sits on bunch of shares and no money to gamble. This is not an investment advise.

Robinhood did not halt trading of securities!,question,45,0.67,locm1q,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/locm1q/robinhood_did_not_halt_trading_of_securities/,72,":See edits at the bottom:

It halted buying only! Why did they not also halt selling?

I feel like this question should be at the forefront of this entire discussion. I don’t see anyone talking about it anywhere and it’s frustrating because it gets right to the core of this issue and provides the answer we are seeking!

Tenev said multiple times in that hearing that they were simply trying to meet regulatory requirements and needed time to raise money to do so, so they halted trading(think he actually says buying). Why did they not also halt selling?

By halting buying only, that forced the price down since most retailers were using Robinhood at that time! That is market manipulation! That is the evidence as far as I’m concerned. It’s right in front of us all! And not being talked about.

I get why you need to stop trading, but they didn’t did they? So wtf? Senators need to ask this question and I would like to get it to them!

Had Robinhood simply halted buying AND selling on Jan 28th, Then those securities would have been safe the following days and not just plummeted. People would have purchased on other brokerages and the stocks would not have been forced down. After re-opening with new capital the stocks would have kept rising as expected. But they didn’t because of Robinhoods actions!

This is enough evidence for me, to prove their guilt and that they actually had intentionally tried to drive the price down to protect their customers. Those customers mainly being Melvin and citadel (the ones who had short positions on these stocks) as we know from the hearing. We are the users, not the customers.

I’m just a retard though so maybe I’m missing something. But at least I’m still 💎🙌 to the end!

Edit1: Yes I know it wasn’t just Robinhood. We’re discussing them because most people who reported issues on Jan 28 were using Robinhood. I didn’t look into the other ones, so I’m not discussing them. I wasn’t even trading GME on 1/28 I was trading CTRM and could not buy, just sell, so I panic sold since I did not understand at the time what was happening and didn’t want to lose my money.

I don’t have much invested that I’m worried, but I just feel like I watched a terrible crime be committed in front of me and no one is talking about it.

If you have evidence that another brokerage had stopped buying only and not selling, then they’re guilty too.

Edit2: So as a few have pointed out this was actually discussed in the hearing, once, very briefly. With ranking Reb memeber McHenry at around minute 53:00 or shortly after. I went and listened again, and still did not like the answer provided, but it was there at least once. I feel like they moved on to easily from that and it should be discussed a bit more. They faced lawsuits either way and customers were going to be upset either way, I don't know if I believe that things would have been worse that way or not, but the point is that it was addressed so I am wrong on that point.

I've been pretty quite the last few weeks and I have a reason why.  


First to answer some questions that no one has ever asked me.

I only played shares.   
Yes I made no money and I'm still holding all my shares  


Now to what I really wanted to state to new WSB members and old members like myself.  


!!!A word of caution!!!  
Several people, people pretending to be normal WSB members have messaged me saying stuff like “nice interview” and “you sounded like a cool guy”. This is very sus.
Nobody has asked for me to either email them or call them, or even meet up. This is even more sus and I think it is reverse psychology to get me to reveal my bank account information.

MY message to these people. Do you think I'm not stupid? I am literally incapable of making money.

Yes I made no money. Deal with it. No need to try and say nice things to me.
No one in my life other than my wife’s boyfriend knows about my loss anyway.


Stay safe kids, the internet is a big place. Don’t let others touch your peepee without paying first.

Commodity Club - Super Cycle Update,dd,131,0.94,lpez3u,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpez3u/commodity_club_super_cycle_update/,57,"Hey all -

I wrote to y'all back in December about an upcoming [Commodity Super Cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdz9v8/commodity_club_welcome_autists/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \- figured it's time for that quarterly update. This will be a rather long post covering most commodities - strap in! My plays are listed at the bottom.

For context into where we are and where we are going - reference the following from November.

https://preview.redd.it/ty12y2x1hyi61.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a854de44adc76b1ab07857abaabc5b09ff8f1d7

As of today - we trade at 436.18. Commodity bull markets last years and historically have always set new highs. Historically oil has led the charge in commodity indexes, but what instead has occurred is an unprecedented spike in metals across the board. Let's dig into charts, understand the rationale for the price action, and look into potential winners in these fields.

**Copper**:

https://preview.redd.it/tvo8j5r2hyi61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a2f845773a969a2cb3ccd9e0677251c2f230a6

Last time we spoke, copper was trading at $3.65/pound and recently ran to $4.15/pound. Part of this is due to [supply constraints](http://www.kitcometals.com/charts/lmewarehouse.html), but realistically this recent run indicates a much larger scenario at play. Paper copper (e.g. futures markets) are being speculated higher with volume as traders believe that future prices will be higher and producers will buy at higher levels. Historically for commodities, spikes with volume indicate significantly higher prices ahead.

Copper has been the largest winner for commodity traders. Big names like $FCX and $CLF have had significant run-ups (80-90%) while less exposed copper producers like $TECK have seen 50%+. COPX - as a mining ETF saw a 50% run-up.

Most miners recently reported earnings. In short, it was amazing. Miners were able to realize prices at $3.20+/pound in Q4 with costs between $1.30-1.40/pound. Here's $TECK's [Q4 financial report](https://www.teck.com/media/Q4-Quarterly-2021.pdf) for more info on guidance, prices, and costs - they made 470m (CAD) in profit on 80k tons of copper. Imagine what it'll look like with copper prices between $3.60-4.20/pound. $FCX expects to sell 3.8b pounds (1.9m tons) of copper in 2021. Even if we estimate copper at $3.60/pound for 2021, they'd net nearly $9b in profit on just copper for the year.

Copper has significant tailwinds for 2021 - increased government stimulus, decreasing DXY, EVs/solar production, batteries, etc. Supply concerns are real given copper's requirements for new technology, and I suspect we will see further run-up and further stock increases alongside massive dividends.

Look to 2008 as an expectation on price action and dividends. I suspect we will see $TECK and $FCX both cross $50/share in Q2 2021 and potentially see dividends over $3/share. $TECK is an equity trade for me given the terrible spreads on options and historically better dividend payouts while I play $FCX for options.

**Zinc**:

https://preview.redd.it/qp0n1tk3hyi61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbf3733f5d811b9bf680b9b38de063a756b13d32

Zinc is fairly unchanged since our last conversation. Zinc - primarily used for galvanizing steel - has essentially followed iron prices. However, it is testing new highs and could be poised for a breakout given recent volume and price action.

Zinc is cheap to mine ($1.10/pound) and higher quantity than copper. $TECK for example produced 3x the amount of zinc than copper, but posted profits only half as much. Zinc has a major catalyst as it relates to government infrastructure spending - all steel that has exposure to water needs to be galvanized. New highways, bridges, buildings, automobiles, solar farms, wind turbines - to name a few - all require galvanized steel. Any price action for zinc can cause significant profits given it's low mining cost and high volume.

$TECK owns the largest zinc mine in the world (Red Dog) and generally zinc has limited exposure in the stock market. Zinc is testing a critical price level, and if it breaks out, we could see $TECK benefitting immensely in their stock price.

**Iron**:

https://preview.redd.it/5t46pre4hyi61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c57ea2af0b49fd7b3e781babaddf617d30565f

Not much has changed for iron either since we last spoke. Iron was in the midst of a major breakout - largely fueled by Chinese Steel demand alongside a new futures market in China providing access for paper trades to front run producers in the futures market. $RIO recently reported a massive earnings beat alongside a special dividend equivalent to 5%. Chinese steel demand should continue to be strong post CNY (as seen in the charts), and will continue to dictate market prices. Iron comes in various forms - primarily 62%, 65%, and pellets, and dictate different prices. 62% iron above $150/ton could well be the new norm for 2021, and continue to provide massive profits to iron miners.

I want to drive your attention towards $VALE who reports earnings this week on Thursday. I've written about $VALE [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksg8nr/commodity_club_nickel_for_your_pickel_vale/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and their attractive share price given iron/nickel exposure. Here's an additional thought to provide confirmation bias into what should be a massive earnings beat and 10%+ gains in equity.

https://preview.redd.it/9dofyqp5hyi61.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cf98a37c509c82113daf7c957a2085817adb700

The above image is from Star Bulks earnings report on Feb 17. They are VALE's largest shipping partner. Their major callout for investors this year is that they've seen record growth in China Steel output and supply recovery in Brazil's mining sector. This is a primary reason for the 91% run up in Star Bulk's share price over the past 3 months. Star Bulk is tiny compared to VALE, but should be a good indicator for a massive earnings beat about to come.

Another parting thought is that $VALE is the largest pellet producer, which drive the highest prices. They produce the highest quality and most expensive iron in the world.

I've been studying port data into China over the past few months (via mysteel.net) - Brazil consistently has outperformed Australia on import expectations and prices. I have extremely high confidence that $VALE should meet/exceed the higher end of earning estimates and provide a special dividend alongside the likes of $RIO and $BHP.

**Oil**:

https://preview.redd.it/y9dgpjwbhyi61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd9fe383030f6340e6d142917e43946c3bedcea

Before I get into details about why I'm bullish on oil, here's a recent look into WTI call volume:

https://preview.redd.it/70wcvijchyi61.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=13216e15fe5efaa9aaf85ea66fe087a04f1839f9

Oil is slowly recovering since the April lows, but has seen significant price action in the past few weeks. Decreasing US production and global oil output from OPEC agreements has sent oil into a supply shock as the US has turned into a net importer of oil and global demand returns to pre-covid levels. Saudi Arabia requires $65/barrel on oil to maintain their government balance sheet, and with US oil production down from decreasing rig counts, reduced drilling from Biden's policies, and recently the Texas freeze, Saudi Arabia is solidly in control and will be targeting higher prices in order to capitalize on US policy.

Oil stocks have not recovered well during covid, and create a unique opportunity to buy in at a discounted price. I cannot name my plays in oil as I've been focusing on small cap stocks - primarily in deep sea rigs and permian basin output, but have been buying ITM long dated calls for Sept 2021 through Jan 2022. My rationale for small cap vs big cap is that small cap is trading at a discount given bankruptcy concerns, and should have that eliminated with the recent price action in oil.

Many oil companies have spent the larger part of 2020 cutting back on drilling costs, refinancing debt, closing down ineffective rigs, reducing management pay, and selling off properties. Oil stocks are a completely different animal in 2021 vs 2020 - they are lean machines ready to take advantage of WTI over $60/barrel. I suspect (and so does GS) that oil will be over $70 in Q2, which should drive significant profits for oil producers. Similar to zinc, oil is a high volume commodity that provides better benefits to producers on small price movements.

Another play on oil will be transport. While $ET stands to benefit from increasing oil prices, tankers should also see increasing demand and rates given the US becoming a net importer of oil. Thanks are equity plays for me as I see them as benefitting from increasing global demand for oil and the US requiring additional imports to stabilize supply given Biden's policies.

**Nickel**:

I mentioned my earlier post about [$VALE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksg8nr/commodity_club_nickel_for_your_pickel_vale/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and why I thought nickel would be the catalyst for their earnings this Thursday. Recent price action continues to confirm my earlier conclusions. From a TA perspective, Nickel has just broken out on massive volume and appears to have established support at $18,155/ton. That's a $4,000+/ton increase from when we last discussed nickel.

Nickel is primarily used as an alloy in stainless steel and to a much lesser extent in batteries. However, that should quickly change in the coming years.

If you are not following Calvin Froedge - I highly recommend giving him a follow. He's posted great info on nickel/cobalt and their future in the EV market. Nickel is quickly becoming a scarce commodity, and current output does not support future demand. Stainless steel demand is not going away, and EV production is coming more quickly than anticipated, and will have significant demand shock on Nickel. $VALE has great exposure to global nickel mining, and should continue to be a global leader in this category given their recent ability to expand into Indonesia.

**Aluminum**:

https://preview.redd.it/3i9q5obfhyi61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b509c1ca3945093ab269b3984a7e47329f2f0

Aluminum has also recently benefited from the surge in commodity prices. Aluminum is an under the radar infrastructure play - it is primarily used in power lines, high rise buildings, appliances, cars, and spacecraft/airplanes. The aluminum market is quite small, so it's easy to pinpoint winners in the recent price surge. High volume in the futures market also indicates further price action ahead.

https://preview.redd.it/ncop5s4ghyi61.png?width=2466&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f3b307ae2579b74830328778086de6e62422c49

Alcoa recently broke out and appears to be ready to run to new highs. For reference - Alcoa traded in the $90s during the early 2000s when aluminum traded at these levels. Alcoa is valued at $4.3b (market cap) with $14b+ in assets and $2b in cash on hand. Debt is low at $.8b given recent sales of underperforming assets. I see them as a clear winner in the space and should see significant price action into Q2/Q3.

**Others**:

There's a few other metals/commodities that deserve further mention - e.g. Palladium, Platinum, Uranium, Lithium, Cobalt, Steel, Natural Gas, Coal, and Tin. Each of those has seen heavy price action and additional breakouts - I personally invest in all of those metals as well, but feel less confident speaking to their future success.

**Summary**:

I'm overweight on all the commodities I specifically went through and have exposure to the ""others"" section as well. Additionally, I have exposure to shipping stocks as I see dry bulk and transport as a clear winner in this space as well. You are not too late to join the commodity club, and should see huge gains in the coming weeks/months/years ahead.

**My Equity Plays:**

I hid the plays that are non-commodities. Most of these plays I reentered last week as I was previously long $PSTH.

I additionally have another $75k I'm planning to use in new positions if I see any further dips in the market. Hopefully we all see massive gains in the near future!",2021-02-22 12:24:06,

This play $CAN print you tendies🚀🚀🚀,dd,15,0.58,lpf0ns,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpf0ns/this_play_can_print_you_tendies/,41,"1 year lurker and now my first DD contribution. I am autistic and am still somewhat new to doing DD on my own so feel free to poke any holes in this theory so I can improve. Obligatory not financial advice.

Obligatory rockets for those who can't read: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Alright so Canaan has a current stock valuation of $26.00. Who are they and what do they do. They are a Chinese based company that specializes in b.rockchain technology as well as AI chips, architectures, algorithms, and system on chips (SoC).

Another noteworthy feature is they are a leading provider of supercomputing solutions and cost efficiency in doing so.

A couple of their products released so far:

Kendryte K210 chip which is an AI chip that is used for both semantic and visual face recognition, image recognition, and anti spoofing that uses a third of the power as typical devices.

This product is implemented in devices such as Kendryte access control which can recognize faces even while wearing masks with 97.4% accuracy!

Their unconscious access control is another great product that does facial recognition that is smaller and can be used as security cameras in places like government facilities and banks and has a 99.96% accuracy. This can be used in conjunction with Self Developed Intelligent IoT SaaS platform; which is a standalone operations they made to that reduces management costs

And the final product that uses the kendryte chip is the smart energy management. Which can provide leakage warnings for water and electricity as well as population mobility forecast and high energy usage warnings.

Their other big product is the Avalon miner series which is a miner for an unmentionable on this sub so I won't be going too deep into this one.

Alright now onto what the heckin heck is a b.rockchain and what are its uses:

A b.rockchain is a database that stores information differently by storing the data in a block and each time new data is created it chains it to the most previous block making a chain in chronological order.

OK now what are it's uses?

* Secure sharing of medical data.
* Music royalties tracking.
* Cross-border payments.
* Real-time IoT operating systems.
* Personal identity security.
* Anti-money laundering tracking system.
* Supply chain and logistics monitoring.
* Voting mechanism.

These are only to name a few uses of b.rockchain technology one of them (IoT) they already have a foot in the door. The other are more speculation on future ways they can expand their business.

So that's the business but how are they doing financially?

Well they had a rough 2020 with covid but since the start of 2020 leading up to now they have been making a huge turnaround and even while they have been down in sales for 2020 their stock has been increasing rapidly which should be a bullish indicator for the company.

&#x200B;

[It looks bad at first but they have had over a 1300&#37; run up since September even with this report.](https://preview.redd.it/hfeyh1i0hyi61.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9bb20aed90380c637be79eb9c1178b97a83dc0b)

They have almost gotten rid of all their debt and still have plenty of liquidity to play with coming into the new year.

Now time for some Greeks.

The farthest out an option you can get is October 15th with a high of a $40 strike price.

The Delta for this option alone is .6275 giving roughly a probability of 62% of being in the money according to people online. That's better odds than the highest odds game in a casino🚀🚀🚀🚀

The Theta for this option is .0267. Which is low for decay considering it is a relatively short LEAP. AKA Theta is the decay of what the option is worth from day to day.

There is HF bullish sentiment in the stock with it now long in 5 portfolios as of December 2020.

OK so what do I buy if I'm interested?

Well you can get stocks if you don't have the money to buy the options for this stock or if you don't like riskier plays. I will be getting the 40c 10/15 at market open and maybe even some shares on top of that.

[https://www.capitalwatch.com/article-5567-1.html](https://www.capitalwatch.com/article-5567-1.html)

Sorry that's all I can do for now its the kids bed time.

Soon to be positions 40c 10/15 and 4 to 5 shares.

TL;DR: This stock has been mooning and still has room to go to infinity and beyond🚀🚀🚀🦧🦧🍌🍌

Pinterest is your express ticket to the moon in 2021. Let me explain.,dd,196,0.89,lpfh2l,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpfh2l/pinterest_is_your_express_ticket_to_the_moon_in/,86,"Hi there. first time posting any DD on here. Please keep your insults gentle. TLDR at the bottom. (play monthly calls at the money and reap benefits)

Pinterest recently jumped due to a strong Q4 ER. Here's what they stated about their 2020

>The company stated that there has been a **35% year-over-year increase in the number of monthly boards created**, including a 44% increase in beauty, a 95% increase in women's fashion and a 36% increase in home decor categories.

Literally, the entire report is a bull's wet dream. Seriously, just read this yourself. https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinterest-pins-to-report-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-store-2021-02-02

Rather than making this post a cliff notes of that let me tell you briefly in my own words why PINS is going to go bananas. 

1) PINS advertisements hide in plain site.

I recommend creating a profile quickly, w/o ad blocker, and give a quick scroll on your home page, or search for something you might think about purchasing or doing later. I think you'll be surprised at how many ads are in your results but also how well they blend in. **why does this matter**

2) this means better conversion rates.

Conversion rates are how advertisers can tell if their ROI is worth it to advertise on a platform. PINS conversion rates are no doubt excellent (we don't have data on this bc it varies from brand to brand) and will continue to be because of the large amount of data they have (they are a god damn search engine, after all. you may have heard of other search engines with excellent ad targeting)

3) PINS is apolitical

this is an advertisers (and users, honestly) wet dream. PINS isn't banning politicians on their platform, and youre only exposed to the political BS you CHOOSE to see. 


4) they have a **GROWTH** mindset

they're not dumb, they understand what makes them money. more active users, more money being spent on the platform in SOME fashion.

to do this, they are dedicated on increasing their MAU (monthly active users) which has already increased 35% as stated above. They're also expanding much faster internationally, for whats it worth. (so if you have bias against the platform because you or nobody you know is on it, think bigger than that.)

they've also begun collaborating with Shopify, which still has a ton of potential in already very smooth shopping experience. (try to replicate a shopping experience on PINS, you will be surprised at how it acts like amazon in this sense offering you different suppliers and options from varying sources)

PINS is just different, and their executives eyes are on the prize. I'm a believer in their goals to increase the bottom lines that will increase their revenue, and I'm all in.

PS - did I mention Cathie Wood is holding a large stake of PINS in her ARKF fund? She holds over 2 million shares in her ETF, making up 3.65% of the fund. https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf

Pinterest Is Unique Among The Social Media Giants

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-unique-among-social-media-211705148.html

> Brian Feroldi: The way I think about Pinterest evaluation is this. The ARPU [average revenue per user] number is the most exciting thing. I think Pinterest can at least 5X its average revenue per user, like at least.
> 
> Brian Withers: That would be half of Facebook.
> 
> Brian Feroldi: Yeah. It would still be [only] half of Facebook. How many users could this platform get? It just added 120 million in the last year. So they're at just under half a billion. Could they get to a billion? Facebook has three billion. Could Pinterest be one-third as popular as Facebook?
> 
> If you can buy that argument, could they double their user base and 5X their average revenue per user? That will be a 10X growth in revenue. Is that realistic? I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.
> 
> Pinterest is a $50 billion [market cap] company. How about this for a comparison? Snapchat, 91 billion. Which platform do you think is more monetizable? Which platform do you think is more niche? If Snapchat is worth 90 billion, I think Pinterest is worth at least 200 billion.
> 
> Brian Withers: As they grow that revenue, that's significantly scalable. They're going to drop more to the bottom line.
> 
> Brian Feroldi: Their gross margin is 82 percent and rising.
> 
> Brian Withers: Yeah, already.
> 
> Brian Feroldi: So, bullish. [laughs]
> 
> Brian Withers: I couldn't tell, Brian, I'm glad you clarified that.

There is so much information out there to confirm the Bull Bias on PINS that it keeps me up at night. I tell everybody I know about this stock. Assuming this takes off it's probably going to Dox me to many I know.

TLDR - PINS is generating stupid cash from advertisers (for being a great search engine and place to shop) because they are increasing their user base at a strong healthy rate, and are dedicating to making sure the train doesnt stop.

I'm new to the reddit game but I've been active at the stonks for a bit over a year now.

I'm a little bit of a fundamentalist so most of my plays don't make ""massive"" GME gains but they make decent safer gains.

That being said I haven't seen this stock mentioned so here's why I think people should be interested:The company pays 99% of it's profits as dividends and it hold a 15% interest in an iron mine. It gets a royalty of the money made and a price per tonnage. Iron has skyrocketed this year for a number of reasons which I'll let you all look into on your own time. But basically the dividend for this company went from 0.44$/share to 1.80$/share (last ex-div was dec 31). Based on iron prices the next one should be even higher.

The current price of the stock is 36.83$, if the dividend stayed the same (which it won't) that's just shy of 5% gains this quarter on the dividend alone. The stock on the other hand is going up in value fast with anticipation.

Big dates:

\-The beginning of March is when they should announce the new massive dividend. So buy in before then.

\-March 31 will likely be the ex-div date.

Anyways let me know what ya thinks!",2021-02-23 21:35:15,

- Biden administration officials said that for two weeks starting on Wednesday, the Small Business Administration will only accept applications for forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans from firms with fewer than 20 employees to ensure that they are not crowded out by larger firms. 
- The UK antitrust tribunal ruled on Monday that Epic Games, the creator of popular game Fortnite, will not be allowed to pursue its case against Apple Inc in the United Kingdom over its App Store payment system and control over app downloads. In August, Epic Games tried to avoid Apple's 30% fee on the App Store by lauching its own in-app payment system. In respond to that, Apple banned Fortnite from its store.
- Investors drove U.S. Treasury yields down from milestone highs on Monday as they looked ahead to remarks U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is set to give on Tuesday in Washington. Powell is scheduled to speak Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, and investors will be watching to see if he offers any changes to the central bank's dovish outlook of recent months as it looks to shepherd the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Millennium Management's Israel Englander earned $3.8 billion last year, landing him the biggest payday of any hedge fund manager in 2020, showed data from Institutional Investor. The top 10 hedge fund managers globally earned $20.1 billion in 2020, a 50.2% rise from $13.4 billion in 2019.
- Spotify said on Monday it would launch in 85 new markets in the next few days which will make the music streaming service available to more than a billion people around the world.
- Investors expect fast economic growth and a lot of inflation. Bond yields increased. Now investors prefer bonds and commodities as the stock market seems too risky in comparison.
- Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said it was time to buy into airline stocks as COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and vaccination rates are all trending in the right direction. (American Airlines (AAL) went up +9.42%, Delta Airlines (DAL) increased by 4.53%).

# Quick Earnings

- **Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL)'s revenue at 34,14M** (prevision : 35,62M). Stock closed at $86.23 (+9.33%) (*Sorry for the people that received my newsletter, it was not 34.14B but 34.14M*)
- **Marathon Oil (MRO)'s revenue at 830,0M** vs 849,54M	forecasted. Stock closed at $10.20 (+7.94%)
- **Home Depot (HD)'s revenue at 32,26B** vs 30,54B forecasted. Pre-market currently at $269 (-2.50%)

*As you may know, I was bullish on Home Depot (short term and long term) and thought they would beat earnings, I'm for sure disappointed but I still see the long term value in it.*

# Quick Things I'm looking for today

- Powell's speech

# Quick Thoughts

**Companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now**

People are scared of inflation and of the stock market. This is old news at this point. So they're looking for other investments, even if it doesn't go up in value, it just needs to beat inflation. Anything that can make them get rid of their dollars.

They're not too happy with gold for some reason (I explain this in the next section). They're trying their hands with beatc01n but that can be a bit risky and too new for some people (old people mostly). So how about alternative investments?

Watches, wine, pens, whiskeys, sneakers, even pokémon cards. Anything, for the love of god take my god damn money!

Oh and when I say people, I'm mostly talking about rich people or anybody with enough disposable income to worry about this stuff.

It happens a lot in the US and in Europe but a place where it might happen much more than usual is China.

You see China has this terrible habit of devaluying their own currency. This helps with exports and with reducing unemployment. But lately, they couldn't keep up with the US (USA Number One!!!) with the trillions poured into the economy. So, right now, China's Yuan is pretty valuable in comparison with the dollar. 

But this will not stay that way, or at least the Chinese government will do everyting in their power to not let that happen. It needs a good economy, low unemployment and overall satisfaction of their population or else their power are in danger. And the devaluation of their currency is one of the sure (very easy) ways of doing so.

So if I was Chinese (I'm not, I'm a martian hiding behind a rock because I've seen an alien coming out of its spaceship, but if I was Chinese), I would buy a lot of watches or anything americans do.

I say ""If I was Chinese"", but again, it's really ""if I had a lot of disposable income and want to diversify my assets to hedge against inflation and currency risks"" and Chinese people are just a more extreme case of this.

So yeah anyway, nice story to say that companies that sell luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now because :

- People want to put their money somewhere (really anywhere!)
- Chinese people want to buy US luxury goods to hedge against the devaluation of their currency
- Rich people want to buy stuff that hold their value without the risk of the stock market
- A lot of rich people *made* money during the pandemic and don't know where to put it
- A lot of people are bored and shopping for anything cool (luxury goods being one of those things)


**Might want to short gold**

Gold has been for decades the best hedge against inflation and stock market risks. That's because it's decorrelated from any currency (dollar, euro, yen or the swedish krona if that's what you're into), because there's a fixed supply of it (by gold mining companies) and because a lot of it is stored safely (in Central Banks reserves).

The price of gold is not too volatile either so it's the perfect hedge to diversify a bit. 

Any metal are viewed as an hedge but gold became the standard for it. That's because a lot of currencies were using the gold standard. Not only that drove Central Banks to store a lot of gold and keep it even after they switched to the monetary system we know now (Money printer brrr and all that) but that ""safety"" feeling that gold had back then stayed in the minds of a lot of people. What kept that feeling alive even further was that it's a tangible asset that had a real world use, not just a piece of paper that holds value just because some big entity said so.

So all that to say : Gold is a good hedge against the market and inflation. Except, right now... investors don't want to touch it that much even when the risks are as high as ever! So why? Well... Let's explore those reasons a bit...

*Before that, I want to give a few disclaimers. First, not financial advice ;) but also, this is mostly speculations. While we can have a good idea as to why the market behaves the way it does, gold is mostly driven by the sentiment of a lot of very different investors with very different perspective, strategies and personal risk tolerance. The stock market and other commodities are like that too but fundamentals play a much bigger role for them. Gold on the other hand is mostly a speculative asset. So that's for the warnings. Now let's see what those reasons are.*

First, gold went up a lot at the beginning of 2020. From $1,500 in March to $2,000 in August. That's a nice 33% increase in an insane bull market. People were eager to put their money in any asset (mostly the stock market but gold was nice too). But in August, gold became overvalued and signs started to appear that this bullish sentiment was not sustainable.

Add to that the fact that the Armageddon that investors feared in March didn't actually happen. Investors wisely switched from gold to stonks and other assets.

But stonks are not the only asset that was down a lot during March. Oil too! There was a mix of geopolitics and people staying at home so didn't need gas. Anyway, when all that fear calmed down, investors bought a lot of oil at those very cheap prices. And oil became the commodity of choice for hedging purposes.

Another asset was chosen : beatc01n (you know what I mean). While it didn't have as much impact on gold as oil and stonks, it still probably hurt it a little.

So you might say ""*that's a nice writup buddy, you're explaining the past here, but you said we should short gold now, so what gives?!*"" Well, first, thanks, I put a lot of effort into those posts and it's nice that it's appreciated! But also, all of those reasons still apply today and there's more.

The rising bond yields make T-Bund much more attractive than gold. Much lower risk with a pretty nice ROI. And if institutions want bigger yields, they are probably ok with buying high yield bonds since the FED and governement seem to do everything they can to keep businesses afloat.

Also, a lot of institutions invest in beatc01n making it a more attractive and legitimate investment. That drives the price higher, therefore making it more attractive and so on...

So, if there's no catalyst that shifts this bearish sentiment, this slow downtrend is set to continue.

The biggest catalyst that I can see for gold is that America (and the rest of the world, there's not just america) reopens but if it does, then that means the economy will be much better and investors will buy stonks even more instead of gold.

Another (small) catalyst is that beatc01n becomes very risky again. Institutions will sell and write off those losses (Elon Musk already said he would do that with his Tesla investment). They will probably buy gold again as a result.

So, in my opinion, the bear thesis boils down to : stocks, oil, beatc01n and bonds and other assets being attractive while gold is being forgotten a bit and that might not change for a while while the bull thesis is that a catalyst might change that sentiment.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

> * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

> * The S&P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

> # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

> * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

> # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

> * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

> * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

> # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

> * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

> * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

> # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

> * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

>Before running a loss, they were generating about $2-4 average Earnings Per Share (EPS). That puts them in line with stores like Best Buy, that hovers around $5-6 EPS.
***
**Response:** GME has had negative EPS since late 2018. You can’t just look back to the good old times and assume they will get back there. GME currently hovers around -$5 EPS.

***
> So $210M of profit – for a company that did $6 BILLION in revenue in 2020 – isn’t a huge lift.
***
**Response:** Except it is a huge lift. They did $6 Billion in revenue and had -$5 EPS. Also, $6 Billion is the lowest yearly revenue GME has had since 2007. 

***
>Here’s the thing – the average Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) for retailers is 20.54 – so <$20 of share price per dollar of EPS. For digital retailers, the average is 38.96 – almost $40 of share price per dollar of EPS.
***
**Response:** PE ratios have gone wild this year so I would not use current PE ratios as a baseline for fundamental value. Apples PE went from 19.73 in early 2020 to 33.92 currently. You compared GME to Best Buy and Best Buy has a PE ratio of 17.71.

***
>Assuming GameStop makes a strong move into the digital space and shores up their balance sheet, their pure fundamental fair value is conservatively (with no short squeeze) anywhere from a minimum of $65 (minimal profits and a market average PE ratio) to $400 (10% profit on 2020 revenue and digital retailer average PE ratio) per share.
***
**Response:** First, those are huge assumptions. GME only has to capture a lot of the digital market and also fix their losing money problem. I have no idea what magic you used to arrive at $65 or $400 per share. Their EPS is very red; their revenue is falling; and now they have to transition their entire business.

GameStop: Your Build-A-PC Workshop,question,252,0.91,lr5tpi,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr5tpi/gamestop_your_buildapc_workshop/,131," 

***TLDR:*** *GameStop can be a build-a-pc workshop with trade-in for a new PC every year (like how people trade in phones)*

I heard this idea being tossed around before and I wanted to make a post to discuss it's potential. First go watch this 40 second video on YouTube since WSB doesn't allow links: 

# NZXT Workshop DLC trailer – PC Building Simulator

[screenshot from the video](https://preview.redd.it/vgryv5esddj61.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e87e17d619445b3562992e05cf406e065b5ed75)

This is a PC Building Simulator but imagine, for a second, if this was real and became GameStop's market place. PC building is hard and not many people either know how or want to do it. That's why people buy PC's pre-built, but it's almost a guarantee that you would get better specs for the same price had you built the PC yourself.

# Building a PC is hard

When I built my PC it took several days for all the parts to ship to my house and the power supply was even delayed for up to 3 weeks, so I could not use my PC when I already had every other component. When it came in, it took 2 hours to build cause I had to open all the boxes, figure out what goes where by searching it up on YouTube, and then stumbling to connect the different wires to the motherboard. Look at this mess. Not my room, but it looked something like this

[PC building catastrophe](https://preview.redd.it/mfgp51gwddj61.jpg?width=454&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a8d7e0b4d943021f13da13b60970e317c31b5c2)

# But it doesn't have to be

Imagine how easy it would be if all the parts are already opened (new/used) and placed on the shelf and you could just swap parts and pick parts as you go with an employee helping you all along the way in case you get stuck. Not only that, the employee could even tell you what parts are the best for what games you want to play. If you only wanted to play Minecraft on low end graphics and don't need a PC for AAA games, they could tell you the parts to get for the cheapest PC that could handle that.

Not only would this open up the gaming world to people who don't have gaming PCs, this is just incredibly convenient. This would also let people stay in a GameStop like it's an Apple store and just hang out and chat with people building their PC.

# Trade Ins

You could trade in your old PC and get a discount in building your new one. This would give value to brick and mortar stores and people could be trading in PCs like they trade in/buy a new phone every year

Would you go to this? I know for a fact that I would. If enough people can just build a PC quickly and more conveniently at a GameStop near them, would this just bring Newegg and other online PC sellers out of business?",2021-02-24 14:33:37,

EV stocks are blood red. Time to buy EV stocks.,question,678,0.94,lr5xnl,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr5xnl/ev_stocks_are_blood_red_time_to_buy_ev_stocks/,282,"In 2009, I watched my 401k get cut in half due to the Great Recession. I didn't want to put a single dollar into the market, but I refused to take a dime out. I was scared. My wife, who is much smarter than me, convinced me to put $10,000 into stocks I thought might survive a decade. I did that, but I also chose one specific sector to favor more heavily than others. I chose infotech. It worked out.

This isn't the Great Recession. Indicators are pointing to a very healthy market ahead and a pretty big swing up--if the virus gets under control.

Today I woke up to find EV stocks on sale. It looks ugly, and there's plenty of reasons why this is happening right now. But the EV market isn't going anywhere; it's simply the future. And because of that, I'm sticking $60,000 into the market again tomorrow, but this time, I'm spreading it across a lot of stocks. Some more speculative than others. Everything will be pure calls or stocks purchases; no puts, no spreads.

Some of these stocks are going to collapse to pennies. Others will more than quadruple in value. I'm making this post so I can come back in ten years and kick myself for not choosing THAT ONE STOCK to invest the whole amount in, just like I did with Netflix. (Though I put most in it.)
I also thought it would be good to get a bunch of EV tickers in the same place, so you can do your own DD and choose which of these might interest you. Or do like me, put larger amounts in the more stable picks, and throw some money on the craps table with some others.

You'll notice some popular stocks missing, because I just don't have any faith in them. Do your own research, and feel free to add more EV stocks below. Also, yes, some of these companies have (and will) merge, but I'm playing them here for different reasons.

TLDR: Buy when there's blood in the streets.
EDIT: I'm up 36% on the day, lol, but these prices will fluctuate heavily, and some will fail and die.

If you've never bought puts here's a free one ~ American Airlines $AAL ~ $19p 3/5,dd,958,0.91,lr6ckb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if_youve_never_bought_puts_heres_a_free_one/,589,"Listen here autists. I know half you idiots held CCIV through merger, bought SNDL at $3, and had PLTR $40 calls. This is my own position to make back some money so I can yolo it again on meme stocks and destroy hedge funds.  Skip to TL;DR if you don't want to see a bunch of maps and shit.

&#x200B;

**SCENARIO:**

Ever since DFV has shown us the glory of short squeezes, there's been an army of idiots attempting to short squeeze any stock with above average short %. This week if you haven't noticed your account is down 50% because there was a ""sEctOr rOtaTion"" into airlines, travel, casinos, hotels. The argument being vaccinestalksgoingwell.exe and reopening have more growth potential than tech (yada yada yield -- BRRRR goes the printer -- tech all day). So the idiots on stock twits, discovered that American Airlines ($AAL) has a >25% short interest and is trading ""below"" pre-pandemic levels. My DD is to prove to you the following i) AAL management team has issued 50% more shares and diluted the tits out of the company therefore the price/valuation are not understood, ii) There is an incoming stock issuance, iii) $19 puts are only $0.31

Shares outstanding refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders. **The number of outstanding shares is used in calculating a company’s market capitalization.** You can see from this graph below -- $AAL has diluted their company by nearly 50% to survive the pandemic.

[American Airline's LTM Outstanding Shares](https://preview.redd.it/bojg1iypddj61.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4984a79b531221dd605996b414e7d722c7a7f09)

This however does not tell the whole story. The company in April took at $6B loan from the treasury. Apart of the agreement, the treasury has the ability to exercise 44M warrants at a strike price of $12.51 cents. This represents 7.8% of the outstanding shares in $AAL.

&#x200B;

[Treasury Program Warrants - 44M shares that can be exercised at $12.51\/share in 2025](https://preview.redd.it/g4p6u0vphdj61.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bd36a59fb55dce48092171e2b60cffe3651bdb)

Don't believe me? Let's have a look at their market cap. Assuming you're a complete imbecile and only look at stock price, sure it looks like $AAL is trading far below pre-pandemic levels. As of close today (2/23/21) $AAL had a market cap of $13.22B. In November of 2019, they had a market cap $13.64B --- except the stock was trading at $30.56. RUH ROH.....

**SHARE ISSUANCE:**

In case you thought they've diluted enough of their failing airline company, just last month (1/29/21) $AAL reached a deal with Goldman and Citi to issue $1.1B MORE IN ADDITIONAL SHARES. Here's my favorite part... the company has decided not to announce when the shares would be issued and barred their executives from speaking to the media. In other words, they have been waiting for retail investors to drive the stock price higher to dump these shares into the market. This $1.1B is as of today 8% of their market cap -- JUICY

**INSIDER SELLING:**

If you need more proof of the stock price going down look what took place last week.... the CEO, CFO, CIO, EVP People - dumped 94,226 shares for a total of $1.7M last week (2/18/21)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Bulls are under the assumption that $AAL can be short squeezed and that it's trading far below pre-pandemic levels when the company has been diluted more than your wife's boyfriend's fleshlight and this fake sector rotation is coming to a quick and bloody end.

**PRICE TARGET: $14-16**

**POSITIONS:**

$19P 03/05/21 --- $0.31 ---> 5.00 16X BAGGER LETS GO BOYS.

YOLO 28X BB FD Options vs 13X AMC FD Options vs 3X GME FD Options for 50% rise in a day,dd,73,0.91,ls91pt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls91pt/yolo_28x_bb_fd_options_vs_13x_amc_fd_options_vs/,14,"Unless you have already hundreds of thousands, to get to 1M above, you need to get hose 10X-20X options.  However, higher IV options means a higher current price whereas a lower IV options appreciates based on both increase in stock price and increase in IV.  Take a look at the current IV of the above three stocks, see the links below.

https://imgur.com/a/g3Ou8E1

Essentially GME IV at 700, AMC at around 300 and BB Options at 100.  For you tards that have no idea what this means…essentially you are too fucking poor to buy GME options.
Now let’s simulate a 50% increase and what that means on the option that is closest OTM.
GME - Stock 168 to 252 Option Feb26 170c  goes from 23.58 to 81.41 (3x assuming IV stays the same)
AMC - Stock 11.1 to 16.65 Option Feb26 12c  goes from .36 to 4.72 (13X assuming IV+100)
BB – Stock 12.4 to 18.6 Option Feb26 12.5c  goes from .213 to 6.10 (28X assuming IV+200)
So my fellow apes and retards, you need about 35K to get to an M on B if it appreciates by 50% in a day
Now of course, the chances of GME going up 50% in a day is much greater than AMC or BB but for BB you literally only need BB to increase to 13.1 or only a 5.6% increase to 3X.
BTW in the last squeeze…BB went from essentially 12 to 26 in 5 days during the GME squeeze…if BB literally only go to 20 in 5 days on the march 5 12.5 c…it goes from .7 to fucking 7.5 or 10.7X",2021-02-25 23:27:11,

Lots of Upside with Upwork,question,9,0.66,ls93m8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls93m8/lots_of_upside_with_upwork/,16,"I posted something similar in r/stocks so I apologize for any redundancy for users of both subs.

Upwork released earnings on Monday after close. Not only did they beat consensus but they raised their guidance rather significantly. More notably, their CEO said that the trend in usage of the platform does *not* seem to be a feature of the pandemic - rather, usership will only go up as we enter re-opening.

For those that don't know, Upwork is kind of like Uber for the gig economy. Economists have been saying this is the future of the job market for years. Say what you will about valuation being stretched (that hasn't seemed to matter the last decade or so), they could be poised to grow massively over the next decade. There is a positive feedback loop as more people adopt the platform. The same way that using Uber, for example, makes you more dependent on using Uber, so does using Upwork. Millennials and Gen Zers have shown a clear desire for career flexibility, which only adds to the bull thesis.

For the sake of this post not just being propaganda, the bear thesis is that it may be overvalued, and that a bigger social media enterprise could build a similar type of platform. To the first, I say maybe, but look at Tesla. To the second, I say, if adoption of the platform is/continues to become significant enough, anyone trying to replicate it will be too late to the party. For example, Facebook has a marketplace now, and have for years, yet eBay is still alive and well, and actually thriving.

This is not financial advice.

Buffet and the gravity of stock market,question,28,0.8,lssm3m,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lssm3m/buffet_and_the_gravity_of_stock_market/,24,"I know you guys might not like this, but the Oracle of Omaha has lots of wisdom:

https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm

This was written in 1999, and we know what happened in the next year and, actually next 10 years to 2009. SP500 Index was around 1200-1400 in the year of 1999, and 10 years later it sits at 900-1000. Of course with dividends reinvested the total return would be higher, but the US stock market in that 10 years period basically comes and goes back to the same place.

However, Buffet was “wrong” about the exact length of the secular bear era, he thought it might be 17 years, but it actually lasted 10 years. After 2009, the yield goes downward again and we saw another 81-98 super bull market.

So what price did we pay? Investors are happy right? Check this plot from Fred:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Pik

The Corp profit/GDP ratio stays at ~10% for a long period, and is the highest since WWII. You know what that means? It means the Corp, as a whole, are taking more slices from the economy pie. And no wonder our income inequality keeps growing, to a record high! 

You know when that income inequality started to rise? Yes, since 1981. Do you also feel the rise of social unrest in recent years? Guess why.

Today at 2021, 10 year treasury yields sit at +1.5%, so the gravity on stocks is rising to an interesting point. What will happen in the next 10 years? I don’t know.

Was very bullish with these partnerships and the market responded with a huge jump up this morning and then market went dead instantly so did BYND. This changes their company for many reasons with these partnerships. 
-They will become a household name and be number one in this plant based food world passing Impossible Meat with this partnership.
-Their partnerships in the last few months are with McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. 
-These partnerships will generate a lot of money in revenue in the next few quarters. 
-Decent high short interest because their evaluation is high but for good reason. They are the Tesla of the food industry. 
-Pandemic is starting to run its course and they took a huge hit because of it. 
-Price really can’t go any lower with all the positive news for 2021. One quarter of exceeding analysts expectations will bring this to $200 plus.

Due Diligence Post - Petrobras (PBR),dd,22,0.7,lts4ip,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lts4ip/due_diligence_post_petrobras_pbr/,44,"This post is the sharing of my due diligence for Petrobras (Ticker ""PBR"" AKA Pabst Blue Ribbon) after their most recent Q4 2020 results from Thursday, February 25, 2021.

Here are the important facts in my opinion:

1. Cash flow from operations during the three months ended 12/31/20 was $7.1 billion USD.  This represents 14% of their market capitalization during one quarter.  In Q1 2021, I expect it will be at least $10 billion, if not more.  That means if they took the cash on hand at 12/31/20 of $13 billion, plus their cash flows from operations during just the fiscal 2021 year, they could buy back more than 100% of their current market cap of common stock.
2. Their stock tends to move in conjunction with oil prices and also the BRL (local currency) compared to the US Dollar.  So when the US Dollar is weaker, the stock goes up.  Over the past 2 months the US Dollar has increased against the BRL by about 12%, pushing the PBR stock price down during that time. I believe with the US Stimulus about to pass, that this trend will reverse back significantly.
3. The recent news on Monday regarding the replacement of the current CEO of PBR with a retired general was due to complaints about Diesel fuel.  The stock dropped approximately 25% due to this news.  When you review the financials, you can see, in Q4 2020 that $3.7 billion of the $13.9 billion of revenues relates to Diesel fuel.  This is about 25% of the revenues of the Company.  However, the discounts that the government is asking PBR to make will not eliminate the revenue, it will potentially cause maybe a 10% reduction.  So this in effect is only a reduction of revenue by 2.5%.   Also, the board of directors has refused to allow this discount so far.  Therefore, I believe the 25% stock price decline is much steeper than the effect to the Company revenues of 2.5%.
4. The Tech industry is declining as interest rates rise.  Investors are in the process of moving into reopening stocks and commodity stocks in 2021.  Therefore, this is a tailwind for PBR; especially considering that Biden wants to shut down oil production in the USA which will further increase the price of oil and will not affect PBR in any way as Brazil doesn't restrict the oil exploration function in Brazil in the same way that Biden wants to in the USA.  So there will be no impairments on PBR's balance sheet like there will be on the USA companies should Biden decide to ban certain oil properties from permitting.
5. Technically, the stock found support on Monday, February 22, 2021 at $7.80 per share and bounced higher.  On Friday, February 26, 2021, the stock did not cross below $7.85, even when the market was moving lower; therefore there is strong support at this level.

My recommendation is first, to review the news and financials on the SEC website regarding PBR.  Then I recommend purchasing shares of the company under ticker PBR.  If you want to increase exposure, I also recommend purchasing long-dated call options at the $8, $9 and $10 levels for either January 2022 or January 2023.

Updates March 4, 2021:

A. President Bolsonaro gave an interview on March 3, 2021 discussing PBR and mentioned the following:

1. He will not interfere or ""nationalize"" the company,
2. He wants to help reduce fraud at the company.
3. He wants the country to stop importing diesel, but rather, thinks that PBR and other local companies can ramp up production to make enough for the whole country.
4. He wants PBR to drill more oil.

B. A second article came out yesterday at [oilprice.com](https://oilprice.com) ([https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Worlds-Next-Big-Offshore-Oil-Region.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Worlds-Next-Big-Offshore-Oil-Region.html)) regarding how South American offshore drilling is the place to be in the world for profitable drilling.  Currently, PBR is drilling offshore wells at a cost of $35 per barrel, and due to a new chemical process called IMO2020, which reduces the sulfur content of offshore oil, it has caused Brazil's pre-salt Buzios and Lula prices to soar, currently they are selling for up to $70 per barrel.  Given that these wells last for many times longer than shale wells, this seems like the best of both worlds, lower cost, and higher selling prices than WTI crude in the USA.

C. Over the past few days the stock has had some selling pressure, however, it reached support of $7.30 and held, and is currently moving higher, as many other oil and gas companies are starting to reach new highs.
